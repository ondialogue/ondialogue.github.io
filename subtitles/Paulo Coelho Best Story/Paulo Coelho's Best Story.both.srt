因为圣徒的手是圣骑士的手触摸的，
For saints have hands that paladins' hands do touch

290
00:31:39,750 --> 00:31:43,083
手掌对手掌是圣洁的手掌之吻。
and palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.

291
00:32:31,583 --> 00:32:33,417
安娜，想出去走走吗？
Ana, want to go for a walk?

292
00:32:34,083 --> 00:32:39,083
真的吗，安娜，他可是派对上最丑最奇怪的男孩！
Really, Ana? The ugliest and weirdest-looking boy at the party!

293
00:32:39,208 --> 00:32:41,208
妈妈。
Mom.

294
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:46,458
对不起。
Sorry.

295
00:33:29,083 --> 00:33:31,583
我父母离开了。
My parents are away.

296
00:33:32,833 --> 00:33:35,542
我想知道你们谁会开车。
I want to know if any of you can drive.

297
00:33:56,583 --> 00:33:58,792
保罗，那里好像有警察。
Paulo, I think it's the police.

298
00:34:11,750 --> 00:34:12,792
那是什么？
What's that?

299
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:16,208
快开，保罗!  我想你撞死了那个男孩了。
Go, Paulo! I think you killed the boy.

300
00:34:34,792 --> 00:34:37,458
再也没有零用钱了，再也不能参加派对了。
No more allowance, no more parties.

301
00:34:38,125 --> 00:34:39,583
现在你得去工作了。
Now you have to work.

302
00:34:39,708 --> 00:34:41,083
如果晚上超过11点，
And if it's later than 11:00 p.m., 

302
00:34:41,083 --> 00:34:42,583
就不许踏进家里半步。
you won't set foot in our house again.

303
00:34:42,708 --> 00:34:44,425
你不能这样对我。
You can't do this to me. 

303
00:34:44,425 --> 00:34:46,625
晚上11点，没得商量。
11:00 p.m. and that's it.

304
00:34:47,833 --> 00:34:50,292
不管你赚多少钱,
And whatever money you earn,

305
00:34:50,417 --> 00:34:54,417
都要去偿还我在那孩子身上花的每一分钱。
will go to pay back every cent that I spend on that boy.

306
00:34:55,750 --> 00:34:57,792
再也没有打字机了。
And no more typewriter.

307
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,667
嗨，怎么了？
Hi. What's up?

308
00:35:09,958 --> 00:35:14,542

- I'd like to talk to Alceu Nogueira.     - Up there.

我是佩德罗·  柯艾略的儿子。
I'm Pedro Coelho's son.

310
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,667
我准备开始工作了。
I'm ready to start.

311
00:35:21,333 --> 00:35:22,917
我的办公室在哪里？
Where is my office?

312
00:35:54,417 --> 00:35:57,542
你怎么了，保罗，你还好吗？
What's gotten into you, Paulo? Are you all right?

313
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:00,083
我好极了！
I'm just great!

314
00:36:00,958 --> 00:36:03,833
可怜的司机！
Poor driver, Paulo!

315
00:36:03,958 --> 00:36:05,417
发生什么事了？
What's going on?

316
00:36:05,542 --> 00:36:09,000
别担心，莫妮卡，我们马上就到。
Don't worry, Monica. We're on our way.

317
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,292
两小时内到。
I'll be there in less than two hours.

318
00:36:11,417 --> 00:36:15,125
你的派对很棒，你吓到我了。
Your party is great. You scared me.

319
00:36:15,250 --> 00:36:17,375
我担心...
I was afraid...

320
00:36:21,583 --> 00:36:23,292
克里斯，如果这是个征兆呢，那会怎么样呢?
What if it was a sign, Chris?

320
00:36:23,292 --> 00:36:25,292
别担心，我们很快就会回来的。
Don't worry. It'll be back soon.

321
00:36:25,417 --> 00:36:28,417
不是信号，而是征兆。
Not the signal, but a sign.

322
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:32,708
不要多想。
Don't even think about it.

323
00:36:32,833 --> 00:36:34,667
这是你的派对。
It's your party.

324
00:36:34,792 --> 00:36:36,958
大家都在等你。
Everyone's waiting for you.

326
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:59,708
克里斯，看看里面有没有地图。
Chris, see if there's a map in there.

327
00:37:02,750 --> 00:37:04,333
没有。
No.

328
00:37:09,417 --> 00:37:11,667
我想我们以前来过这里。
I think we've been here before.

329
00:37:45,583 --> 00:37:46,917
等一下，保罗。
Just a second, Paulo.

330
00:37:48,042 --> 00:37:49,125
你不来吗？
You're not coming?

331
00:37:49,250 --> 00:37:50,220
你要去哪里?	
Where are you going?

331
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,500
如果我知道，我会告诉你的。
If I knew, I'd tell you.

332
00:37:52,625 --> 00:37:55,500
但我会找到办法的。
But I'll get somewhere.

333
00:37:57,333 --> 00:38:00,208
我知道你会的。
I know you will.

334
00:38:40,083 --> 00:38:41,708
保罗，你在干什么？
Paulo, what are you doing?

335
00:38:47,958 --> 00:38:54,000
圣地亚哥之路，2013年
CAMINO DE SANTIAGO, 2013

336
00:38:57,750 --> 00:38:59,833
我的鞋。
My shoe.

337
00:39:09,833 --> 00:39:11,000
少即是多
LESS IS MORE

338
00:39:11,125 --> 00:39:13,500
把你带不动的重物留在这里
LEAVE ALL THE WEIGHT YOU CANNOT CARRY HERE

339
00:39:24,417 --> 00:39:26,750
- 你没事吧?                   - 我没事。
- Are you all right?	       - Yes, I am.

339
00:39:29,633 --> 00:39:32,699
哦，天哪，真的是他吗？
Oh, my God, is it really you？

339
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:34,533
当然是他。
Of course he is.

339
00:39:34,766 --> 00:39:35,833
真是一个耻辱。
It's a shame.

339
00:39:35,833 --> 00:39:39,433
但从近处看，没有人是他们看起来的样子。
But from up close, no one is whom they seem to be.

340
00:39:40,399 --> 00:39:42,499
他和我都一样，
He's all just like me,

340
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:45,999
总是想回到同一个地方。
always wanting to come back to the same place.

340
00:39:49,333 --> 00:39:52,083
你知道这次你要找什么吗？
Do you know what you're looking for this time?

341
00:39:52,708 --> 00:39:56,250
还不知道，但我肯定能找到。
Not yet. But I'm sure I'll find it.

342
00:40:03,542 --> 00:40:09,625
每个人都尽可能讲述自己的故事。
Everybody tells their story as best they can.

343
00:40:12,250 --> 00:40:14,625
或者以他们想要的方式讲述。
Or the way they want to.

344
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,125
如果我们能改变生命，
Life is only really worth it

345
00:40:57,500 --> 00:41:00,500
它才真正值得。
if we can change it.

346
00:41:35,417 --> 00:41:37,333
只是为了客厅。
Just for the living room.

347
00:41:37,458 --> 00:41:38,875
- 你什么都没说                      -儿子。
- You never said anything. 	- Son.

348
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:41,792
过来和我们一起吃晚饭，打电话给你姐姐。
Come and eat dinner with us. Call your sister.

349
00:41:41,917 --> 00:41:43,208
我不饿。
I'm not hungry.

350
00:41:43,333 --> 00:41:45,333
需要我给你留点吃的，
Do you want me to save you some food 

350
00:41:45,333 --> 00:41:46,458
等你回来吗？
for when you come back?

351
00:41:46,583 --> 00:41:48,417
不用了，谢谢。
No, thanks.

352
00:41:48,542 --> 00:41:52,167
晚上11点，我就会锁门，晚回来的话你就进不来了。
At 11:00, I lock the doors and you can't come in.

353
00:41:53,333 --> 00:41:56,792
我20岁了，我有自己的生活，我想做什么就做什么。
I'm 20 years old. It's my life. I'll do as I like.

354
00:41:56,917 --> 00:41:59,458
除非我帮你付账单。
Not while I pay your bills.

355
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,750
你满脑子想的都是这个。
That's all you think about.

356
00:42:01,875 --> 00:42:03,708
太好了！
Far out!

357
00:42:03,833 --> 00:42:07,500
什么，付账单和赚钱吗？
What, paying bills and making money?

358
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:10,000
真正离谱的是
What's really far out is 

358
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:12,000
你根本不在乎，孩子。
that you don't care about that, kid.

359
00:42:12,125 --> 00:42:13,292
在乎什么？
What for?

360
00:42:13,792 --> 00:42:16,750
就像你那样抛弃我的生活吗？
To throw my life away, like you did with yours?

361
00:42:16,875 --> 00:42:19,042
省钱建那个可笑的房子吗？
Saving money to build this ridiculous house?

362
00:42:20,833 --> 00:42:23,583
资本家! 雇佣兵！
Capitalist! Mercenary!

363
00:42:25,583 --> 00:42:29,375
那你是什么? 你是共产主义者吗？
And what are you? Are you a communist?

364
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,875
- 这有什么不对吗?	                      - 亲爱的上帝...
- And what's wrong with that?    -  Dear God...

365
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:35,083
这个国家的总统是个将军。
The president of this country is a general.

366
00:42:35,208 --> 00:42:38,583
你知道军事独裁是什么吗?   知道吗？
Do you know what a military dictatorship is? Do you?

367
00:42:38,708 --> 00:42:41,417
你知道将军们怎么对付共产党吗？
Do you know what generals do with communists?

368
00:42:42,583 --> 00:42:44,833
我能忍受你，我能忍受任何事。
I've put up with you. I can put up with anything.

369
00:42:45,667 --> 00:42:46,792
我的上帝...
My God...

370
00:42:48,125 --> 00:42:51,292
上帝是你忘恩负义的见证人。
God is a witness of your ungratefulness.

371
00:42:51,417 --> 00:42:53,792
你会得到你应得的。
You'll get what you deserve.

372
00:42:54,292 --> 00:42:58,667
- 我保证你会的。					- 希望如此。
- I promise you will.                - I hope so.

出去。
Get out.

00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:02,375
滚！
Go!

走开。
Go away.

376
00:43:08,417 --> 00:43:11,667
最后一步，1，2，3，停。
Last move. 1, 2, 3, stop.

377
00:43:11,792 --> 00:43:14,458
恭喜你们，真的很棒。
Congratulations, guys. It was really good.

378
00:43:14,583 --> 00:43:18,958
我觉得你最后应该多走动走动。
I think you should move around a little more in the end.

379
00:43:19,083 --> 00:43:21,167
卡洛斯，我想和你谈谈。
Carlos, I'd like to talk to you.

380
00:43:21,708 --> 00:43:23,917
我以为你抛弃我们了。
I thought you'd abandoned us.

是新剧本。
New play.

383
00:43:31,417 --> 00:43:34,000
真的吗，让我看看。
Really? Let me see it.

384
00:43:34,125 --> 00:43:38,667
- 安娜，我们要开始了。       - 不，等一下。
- Ana, we're about to start. 	 -  No, just a second.

385
00:43:38,792 --> 00:43:40,667
我们得开始排练了。
We have to start rehearsing now.

386
00:43:40,792 --> 00:43:44,542
- 弗拉维奥还没来呢              - 他不会来了。
- Flavio isn't even here yet. 	- He's not coming.

387
00:43:46,875 --> 00:43:49,625
也许那个瘦子可以扮演他的角色。
Maybe the skinny guy can play his role.

388
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:51,542
- 不要啦。            - 他扮小丑一定很好看。
- Of course not. 	  -  He'll look great as a clown.

389
00:43:51,667 --> 00:43:54,750
别说了，我朋友是来看我的。
Stop it! My friend's here to visit me...

390
00:43:54,875 --> 00:43:57,125
我可以扮小丑。
I can play the clown.

00:43:58,083 --> 00:44:00,250
我想扮演。
I want to do it.

392
00:44:02,875 --> 00:44:06,125
- 你是认真的吗？      - 是的。
- Are you serious?       - Yes, I am.

393
00:44:06,750 --> 00:44:08,583
你叫什么来着？
What's your name again?

00:44:09,083 --> 00:44:11,417
- 马可            - 马可

395
00:44:12,750 --> 00:44:15,750
我也是演员，我没告诉过你吗？

396
00:44:16,292 --> 00:44:17,792
没有。
No.

397
00:44:17,917 --> 00:44:19,792
我来扮小丑。
I'll play the clown.

398
00:44:54,250 --> 00:44:58,833
当春天的土豆发芽的时候,
When the spring potato sprouts,

399
00:44:58,958 --> 00:45:01,792
它就会蔓延到整个地面。
it spreads all over the ground.

400
00:45:10,333 --> 00:45:13,958
当小女孩睡着的时候,
When the little girl sleeps,

401

00:45:22,417 --> 00:45:25,083
现在这个问题不会停止。
Now the question that won't stop.

403
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:30,042

- Who wants a chocolate?     - I do!

404
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:32,542
我听不见哦。
I can't hear you.

405
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:35,042
我要！
I do!

406
00:45:35,167 --> 00:45:37,250
太好了！
All right!

407

你必须保持冷静，佩德罗。

你在哭吗? 为什么? 你不高兴吗？

好像你不喜欢掌声似的。
As if you didn't like the applause.

504
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:26,292

听着,
But listen,

你觉得有多少人会看你的杂志？

618
01:11:35,667 --> 01:11:37,125
很多，怎么了？

627
01:12:08,083 --> 01:12:10,208
这不正点。
It's not square.

628
01:12:10,458 --> 01:12:12,250
这家伙...
This guy is...

629
01:12:14,083 --> 01:12:15,250
他...
He...

630
01:12:15,375 --> 01:12:18,250
我不知道他想干嘛。

我试试看。
I'll try.

633
01:12:24,583 --> 01:12:27,958
谁知道呢，也许音乐这件事会成功。
Who knows, maybe the music thing will work out.

634
01:12:28,083 --> 01:12:30,917
也许会...
Maybe it will...

635
01:12:32,583 --> 01:12:34,292
但是唱片公司总裁呢？
but record label executive?

636
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:36,917
他有点怪。
He's a bit weird.

637
01:12:37,917 --> 01:12:40,792
他说的那些话...
The things he says...

638
01:12:42,125 --> 01:12:46,625
我忘不了我在电视上看到的内容。
And I can't forget that thing I saw on TV.

639
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:48,340
那是史波克（星际迷航角色）说的。			
That thing Spock said. 

639
01:12:48,340 --> 01:12:49,458
你在开玩笑吗，保罗？
Are you kidding, Paulo?

640
01:12:49,583 --> 01:12:54,375
这是个征兆，我很确定。
It's a sign, I'm sure of it.

641
01:12:55,292 --> 01:12:58,833
看看你怎么想，你知道该怎么做。
See what you think of it. You know what to do.

642
01:12:59,958 --> 01:13:01,625
让我看看...
Let me see...

643
01:13:03,000 --> 01:13:11,625
人的自由就是宇宙的正义。
The freedom of man is the justice of the universe.

645
01:13:12,167 --> 01:13:14,292
当阿尔 · 卡彭...

646
01:13:14,417 --> 01:13:17,375
- 阿尔 · 卡彭		- 我知道。
- Al Capone. 		- I know.

647
01:13:19,667 --> 01:13:22,167
“宇宙的正义?”
‟The justice of the universe”?

648
01:13:23,625 --> 01:13:27,292
保利尼奥，这真是太正点了!
Paulinho, this is so square!

649
01:13:27,417 --> 01:13:29,583
我觉得不是这样的。
I don't think that's the way.

650
01:13:29,708 --> 01:13:32,292
我告诉过你，我不会写歌。
I told you I don't know how to write songs.

651
01:13:32,417 --> 01:13:34,667
- 别这么说			     - 我就是这么写的。
- Don't say that. 	    - That's how I write.

652
01:13:34,792 --> 01:13:35,708
这不可行。
No way.

653
01:13:35,833 --> 01:13:40,083
歌曲是为了传递信息，你不需要花哨。
To get a message across, you don't need to be fancy.

654
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:43,958
你可以简单些，用词必须简单。
You can keep it simple. You must keep it simple.

655
01:13:44,083 --> 01:13:45,390
那要怎么做呢？	
But how?		

655
01:13:45,390 --> 01:13:49,500
简单，直接，向前迈进。
Simple, direct, forward.


657
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,833
我明白了，比如:
I get it, something like:

658
01:13:51,958 --> 01:13:54,208
嘿，阿尔·卡彭，看看你是否弄明白了。
Hey, Al Capone, see if you get it straight.

659
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:56,458
就是这样！
That's it!

660
01:13:56,583 --> 01:13:58,292
你得要领了！

661
01:13:58,417 --> 01:14:01,083
嘿，阿尔·卡彭，看看你是否弄明白了。

01:14:03,583 --> 01:14:09,417
嘿，阿尔·卡彭，看看你是否弄明白了。
Hey, Al Capone, see if you get it straight.

664
01:14:11,542 --> 01:14:12,583
- 明白了吗？    - 明白了。
- Got it?	          - I got it.

665
01:14:12,708 --> 01:14:14,167
- 让我试试		- 更直接一点。
- Let me try. 	- More direct.

666
01:14:14,292 --> 01:14:16,625
稍后我想和你谈谈 
Later I want to talk to you about 

666
01:14:16,625 --> 01:14:18,625
CBS 投资我杂志的事。
CBS investing in my magazine.

667
01:14:18,750 --> 01:14:22,792
算了吧，音乐才是真正的东西。
Forget about that, music is the real thing.

668
01:14:22,917 --> 01:14:26,833
音乐触及人们的灵魂。
It's music that reaches people's souls.

669
01:14:26,958 --> 01:14:28,420
但杂志也...				
But the magazine also...

670
01:14:28,420 --> 01:14:33,458
问题是，你想与世界对话。
The thing is, you want to talk to the world.

671
01:14:33,583 --> 01:14:36,542
你有很多话要说，不是吗？
You have a lot to say, don't you?

672
01:14:36,667 --> 01:14:39,542
你想成为比你自己更强大的人，对吗？
You want to be bigger than you are, right?

673
01:14:40,250 --> 01:14:41,917
那么...
So...

674
01:14:42,042 --> 01:14:44,917
来，跟我一起，兄弟。
Come with me, brother.

675
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:54,000
嘿，阿尔·卡彭，看看你是否弄明白了。
Hey, Al Capone, see if you get it straight.

676
01:14:55,417 --> 01:14:58,833
照现在的情况...
The way things are going

677
01:14:58,958 --> 01:15:01,033
伙计,继续...
Man... 

677
01:15:01,033 --> 01:15:03,833
芝加哥跟不上你的脚步
Chicago won't keep up with you.

678
01:15:03,958 --> 01:15:06,750
芝加哥跟不上！
Chicago won't keep up!

679
01:15:07,042 --> 01:15:08,875

你真是个天才! 你彻底明白了！

他们知道了你在国税局的欺诈行为。
They know about your fraud with the IRS.

684
01:15:29,000 --> 01:15:31,792
嘿，凯撒大帝，别去参议院。
Hey, Julius Caesar, don't go to the Senate.

685
01:15:31,917 --> 01:15:35,042
他们知道了你控制国家的阴谋。
They know about your plot to control the State.

686
01:15:35,167 --> 01:15:37,625
嘿，兰皮昂，离开这里。

687
01:15:37,750 --> 01:15:40,458
他们要把你的头拿去展览。
They're going to the fair putting your head on exhibit.

688

嘿，阿尔·卡彭，看看你是否弄明白了。

圣地亚哥之路，20世纪80年代

就像你已经死了一样。
as if you were dead.

701
01:17:06,917 --> 01:17:09,125
想象一下你葬礼的每个细节，
Picture every detail of your funeral 

701
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,125
就好像明天就要举行一样。
as if it were to happen tomorrow.

702
01:17:11,250 --> 01:17:13,283
唯一的区别就是。
The only difference is 

702
01:17:13,283 --> 01:17:15,583
你被活埋了。
that you are being buried alive.

703
01:17:16,083 --> 01:17:18,667
随着时间的流逝,
As history develops,

704
01:17:19,292 --> 01:17:22,417
人们走进教堂，走向坟墓,
the Church, the walk towards the grave,

706
01:17:24,333 --> 01:17:26,625
坟墓里的虫子叮咬你...

慢慢地伸展你的肌肉，用力动动身子,

711
01:17:43,125 --> 01:17:45,958
我们需要更有力的歌词。

这不正是我们想要的吗？
Isn't it what we want?

734
01:18:49,417 --> 01:18:52,042
我们想要，如果我想要，你也想要

你总是抱怨孤独，
you're always complaining about solitude,

802
01:23:35,917 --> 01:23:42,500
你是用铁和火铸成的，佩德罗。
you were made with iron and with fire, Pedro.

803
01:23:43,000 --> 01:23:47,875
可惜你不知道

这是什么鬼东西？

这是我和劳尔·塞克萨斯一起做的唱片。

812
01:25:42,333 --> 01:25:45,250
但是“ Krig-ha，Bandolo”是什么意思呢？

意思是“小心，敌人就在附近”

什么政府? 跟这没关系。
What government? It has nothing to do with it.

开什么玩笑，我们看起来像小丑吗？
Are you kidding me? Do we look like clowns to you?

820
01:26:04,917 --> 01:26:07,792
不，先生，我说的是实话。

826
01:26:19,750 --> 01:26:22,667
是的，我真的不知道。
No, I really don't.

827

普利尼奥，打开机器,
Plinio, turn on the machine,

828
01:26:26,042 --> 01:26:29,292
这样我们就可以把我们朋友的想法理顺。
so that we can put our friend's ideas in order.

829
01:26:29,417 --> 01:26:31,042
你要折磨我吗，先生？
Are you going to torture me, sir?

830
01:26:31,167 --> 01:26:32,750
- 不，我不会的       - 再来一遍吗，先生？
- No, I'm not. 	         - Again, sir?

01:26:42,250 --> 01:26:46,708
来吧，普利尼奥，看看我的档案，黑名单。
Go ahead, Plinio. Take a look at my file, the black list.

835
01:26:46,833 --> 01:26:50,417
这就证实了这一点。“疯子，疯子!”
That will confirm it. ‟Crazy, lunatic!”

836
01:26:53,083 --> 01:26:54,708
我进过精神病院，先生。
I was in a mental institution, sir.

837
01:26:54,833 --> 01:26:56,500
- 真的吗？	     - 真的。

但这不是折磨。

对我来说，折磨就是抽血。
Torture is drawing blood.

- 你喜欢血，对吧?				      - 我喜欢。

For Saint Cyprian,

862
01:29:12,250 --> 01:29:16,792
路西法策划了一场反对魔王的政变，夺取了政权。
Lucifer staged a coup d'etat against Beelzebub and took power.

863
01:29:16,917 --> 01:29:19,292
他们之间的分歧
And the disagreements between the two of them

864
01:29:19,417 --> 01:29:23,042
阻碍了地球上的邪恶500年,

865
01:29:23,167 --> 01:29:26,625
已经结束的五个世纪。
Five centuries that have come to an end.

866
01:29:26,750 --> 01:29:32,625
这种魔法现象，这种对魔法的突然兴趣,

867
01:29:32,750 --> 01:29:36,042
在电影《驱魔人》中出现的整个事件

868
01:29:36,167 --> 01:29:41,292
被认为是原因，而实际上是结果。

869
01:29:41,958 --> 01:29:45,792
还有我刚写的那首歌“ Gita”谈到...
And the song ‟Gita,” which I just wrote, talks about...

870
01:29:45,917 --> 01:29:48,208
“我刚写的”？
‟I just wrote”?

871
01:29:48,333 --> 01:29:51,625
- 善与恶合二为一				        -“我刚写的”？！
- Good and evil as one thing. 	- ‟I just wrote”?!

872
01:29:51,750 --> 01:29:56,042
善恶结合在一起，将上帝作为一个整体呈现出来。
Together, they bring out God as a whole in person.

873
01:30:00,500 --> 01:30:04,375
当我在世界的四个角落寻找的时候。

874

祂终于在梦里告诉我。

875
01:30:13,042 --> 01:30:16,417
有时候你问我：
Sometimes you ask me:

876
01:30:16,958 --> 01:30:20,750
为什么我这么安静？
Why I'm so quiet?

877
01:30:21,583 --> 01:30:25,083
我几乎不谈爱情。
I barely speak of love.

878
01:30:25,958 --> 01:30:29,958
我不会陪在你身边，微笑着。
And I don't stay by your side, smiling.

879
01:30:30,083 --> 01:30:33,625
你无时无刻不在想我。
You think of me all the time

880
01:30:34,833 --> 01:30:38,083
你掏空我，耗尽我，然后离开我。
You eat me, you spit me out, you leave me.

881
01:30:39,083 --> 01:30:42,417
也许你不明白。
Maybe you don't understand.

882
01:30:43,292 --> 01:30:48,792
但今天我要让你看看。
But today I'll show you.

883
01:30:49,417 --> 01:30:53,250
我是星星的光芒
I am the light of the stars

884
01:30:54,083 --> 01:30:57,417
我是月光的颜色
I am the color of the moonlight

885
01:30:58,417 --> 01:31:01,917
我就是生命中的事物
I am the things in life

886
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:05,083
我是爱的恐惧

887

魔法誓言是一种纽带
A magic oath is a link

888
01:31:07,750 --> 01:31:11,208
而且必须是真正意志的主张...
And it must be the assertion of true will...

889
01:31:11,333 --> 01:31:13,125
它是一种纽带，
It's a link

890
01:31:13,250 --> 01:31:17,083
在人类意识和神性意识之间的纽带。
between human consciousness and divine consciousness.

891

发生什么事了？

我喜欢 A 面。
I like the A side.

897
01:35:38,625 --> 01:35:40,833
背面也不错。
But this one is good too.

898
01:35:41,208 --> 01:35:43,083
我们喜欢同一张唱片。
So we like the same one.

899
01:35:46,625 --> 01:35:49,083
我也有我的秘密。
I also have my secrets.

900
01:35:58,000 --> 01:35:59,333
对不起，孩子。
I'm sorry, son.

901
01:36:01,667 --> 01:36:03,792
你为什么现在告诉我这些？
Why are you telling me this now?

902
01:36:05,375 --> 01:36:07,542
因为你是我儿子。
Because you're my son.

903
01:36:09,625 --> 01:36:12,250
作为你的父亲，我真的很自豪。

属于自己的房子，我感到很自豪。”

905
01:36:18,500 --> 01:36:20,208
用我自己的方式。
In my own way.

906
01:36:23,417 --> 01:36:25,917
必须用你自己的方式。
It had to be in your own way.

907
01:36:31,833 --> 01:36:36,750
实际上，唱片B面的歌要好一点。
Actually, this song on the B side is a little better.

908
01:36:52,917 --> 01:36:54,875
谢谢，爸爸。

记住，为了正义之战，我们需要寻求帮助。

916

如果我们不能理解这一点，

916
01:38:30,283 --> 01:38:32,083
我们将成为傲慢的战士。
we will be arrogant warriors.

917
01:38:32,208 --> 01:38:34,292
最终，我们的傲慢会击败我们。
In the end, our arrogance will defeat us.

918
01:38:34,417 --> 01:38:36,667
我们对自己盲目自信，

919
01:38:36,792 --> 01:38:40,083
以至于我们无法看到战场上的陷阱。

否则，它没有意义。
Otherwise, it doesn't make sense.

我说的不是这个。
I'm not talking about that.

一切都是一回事,
Everything is one thing only

939
01:42:17,667 --> 01:42:23,208
当你真心渴望某样东西时，

整个宇宙都会联合起来帮助你实现 。

想读你写的东西吗？

保持静默，观察你周围的动象。

这个神奇的瞬间就是
