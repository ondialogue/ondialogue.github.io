it might be surprising and it might not be,

have been rooting for collapse for a long time

Why have I been rooting for collapse?

315
00:15:48,866 --> 00:15:51,900
walking in two different paradigms

324
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,000
And so,
而且，

325
00:16:11,666 --> 00:16:13,433
and there may be more than these two right.

326
00:16:15,400 --> 00:16:17,000
This is something that I feel like is really
这让我感到在这个时候

327
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,766
important at this time for us to consider
考虑到范式是一种选择

328
00:16:19,733 --> 00:16:21,333
that paradigm is a choice.
是真正重要的事情。

00:16:22,666 --> 00:16:23,900
Paradigm is a choice.
范式是我们的一个选择。

330
00:16:24,666 --> 00:16:27,633
So I present indigenous paradigm in circumstances
在当下这个专题研讨会的情况下，

332
00:16:27,633 --> 00:16:29,566
like the one we find ourselves here on this panel
我向大家展示原住民范式，

333
00:16:29,566 --> 00:16:37,166
to say, it's not something that we can only imagine, or it's not a fantasy world, or a pipe dream
我们在说的不是想象的事、也不仅仅是童话世界或白日梦

336
00:16:37,166 --> 00:16:40,466
so to speak it's like there are people doing it already.
而是在说已经有人在做的事。

338
00:16:41,333 --> 00:16:45,500
So humans can absolutely do this we can witness them.
所以人类绝对可以做这些事，我们可以见证。

340
00:16:46,033 --> 00:16:52,066
And so I think there's a longing and
我认为原住民有个渴望，

344
00:16:52,133 --> 00:16:54,033
most indigenous peoples that I meet
我遇到的许多原住民，

345
00:16:54,033 --> 00:16:55,766
for a return to what was before.
渴望回到从前。

346
00:16:58,533 --> 00:17:03,443
And so this turning I would say

348
00:17:03,443 --> 00:17:06,166
is in some ways a turning backward
在某种方式上是

349
00:17:07,333 --> 00:17:08,900
to another understanding and 
回转到另一种理解，

350
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:13,233
to an awakening of of witnessing
回转到见证的觉醒上。

351
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:16,566
I guess I'll say the return of original instructions
我猜想我将会说回归到原始结构上

352
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:19,233
or the understanding of what, how exactly is 
或者是理解这个地球到底

353
00:17:19,533 --> 00:17:26,600
this earth construct made and what is our place in it,
是由什么构成，怎么构成的，我们在其中的位置是什么，

356
00:17:26,600 --> 00:17:28,866
so I talk often about who we are where we are

357
00:17:28,866 --> 00:17:32,933
how it is.
怎么样等等。

359
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,533
As Thich Nhat Hahn has pointed out
正如一行法师指出的，

360
00:17:35,533 --> 00:17:37,300
he gives us a great indigenous word 
他用英文给了我们一个伟大的

360
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:38,100
through the English language
原住民词语，

362
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:39,466
he calls us interbeing.
他称我们为“互在”。

363
00:17:40,600 --> 00:17:42,466
We are so interrelated,
我们是如此相互关联，

364
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,700
so deeply interrelated.
如此深入地相互关联。

365
00:17:46,900 --> 00:17:49,800
And so here's the spiritual dilemma is that

366
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,266
here we are in a free will construct

367
00:17:51,266 --> 00:17:52,433
where everybody gets to do

368
00:17:52,433 --> 00:17:54,266
whatever the heck they dream up to do.

369
00:17:54,366 --> 00:17:56,126
And it's not only human species that

372
00:17:56,126 --> 00:18:00,533
are involved in this free will business, it's all species.
参与到自由意志中，所有物种都参与其中。

373
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,400
I would say
但在这里，

374
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:06,133
but here we are human beings and with the power
我会这么说，我们是人类，有能力

377
00:18:06,233 --> 00:18:08,266
and choice to do anything we can dream up.
而且有选择去做我们梦想的任何事。

378
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,000

and credit scores of all the possibilities

382
00:18:19,466 --> 00:18:23,000
So, but we can make other choices, right?
但是，我们可以做出其它选择，对吗？

384
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,366
And so in this paradigm to understand

386
00:18:28,566 --> 00:18:30,766
the great turning is the recognition of
大转折是要认识到

387
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,066
the laws of this construct
这种构建法则

388
00:18:33,633 --> 00:18:35,966

can choose anything we want to do

390

00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:46,100
affects every other being on the planet.

So what is your choice to be?

393
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:51,466
And I see I might at times I'll say one of the piece

394
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,323
that you know for us we say that 
对我们而言，

395
00:18:53,323 --> 00:18:55,233
we've already passed through many worlds

398
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:05,323

399
00:19:05,323 --> 00:19:10,400
philosophically about what is called for at this moment.

there for us to exploit from a place of separation.

so that they can own everything on earth

a very, very conservative young republican that point.

rather than try to tell a new story from this point forward

in many ways I feel like this co-witnessing

is the retelling of the old story on one level.
在某种角度上而言是在重述老故事。

asking what does it mean to retell the old story.

 the spirit of King Ferdinand

even from the spirit world, right?
即使是来自灵性世界，是不是？
