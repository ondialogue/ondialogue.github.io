2
00:00:30,140 --> 00:00:32,210
有一个古老的日本寓言，
There's an old Japanese parable

3
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:38,250
讲述了一个陷入困境的战士，
about a troubled warrior who is haunted

4
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:41,392
被他在战斗中夺取的生命的幽灵所困扰。
by the ghosts of the lives he took in battle.

8
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:49,860
你是伟大的丝绸圣人吗？
Are you the great silk sage?

10
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:56,220
我必须知道天堂和地狱是否存在。
I must know if heaven and hell exist.

12
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:02,590
那么多人被屠杀了。
So many have been slaughtered.

13
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:07,291
对他们来说，我希望他们能进入天堂。
For them, I hope there is a heaven.

14
00:02:07,291 --> 00:02:11,760
但我杀了那么多人，对我来说,
But I have killed so many, and for me, 

15
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,680
我祈祷没有地狱。
I pray there is no hell.

17
00:02:18,070 --> 00:02:20,370
求你了，我一定要知道！
Please, I must know!

19
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:25,120
我不想把这样的智慧浪费在
I would not want to waste such wisdom

20
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:27,171
你这样一个无情的懦夫身上。
on a heartless coward like you.

22
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:32,540
你说什么，老太婆？
What did you say, old woman?

23
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:34,880
你打算用那个做什么？
What did you intend to do with that?

24
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:39,850
杀一个手无寸铁的女人来证明你是个懦夫？
Prove that you're a coward by killing a defenseless woman?

25
00:02:39,850 --> 00:02:42,570
我从未见过如此软弱的战士。
I've never seen such weakness in a warrior.

27
00:02:48,546 --> 00:02:51,534
这就是地狱。
That is hell.

29
00:03:24,402 --> 00:03:27,390
那就是天堂。
And that is heaven.

30
00:03:45,210 --> 00:03:50,233
{\an2}<font size="120px"><font color="yellow">心的力量</font></font>

31
00:03:50,310 --> 00:03:53,233
我的名字是玛雅·安吉洛，
My name is Maya Angelou, 

32
00:03:53,233 --> 00:03:58,700
我相信心是我们生命中最有力量、
and I believe that the heart is the most forceful, 

33
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:04,324
最有影响力的元素。
impactful element in our lives.

35
00:04:07,290 --> 00:04:12,010
你将永远无法发挥其全部潜力，
You will never ever reach their full potential,

36
00:04:12,010 --> 00:04:13,769
如果你不敞开心扉的话。
if you don't open your heart.

38
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,810
心的力量是
And the power of the heart is  

39
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:27,980
在最深的层次上与「你是谁」联系密切。
to be connected with who you are at the deepest level.

40
00:04:27,980 --> 00:04:30,940
我们在诗意的意义上想到了心，
We think of the heart in the poetic sense, 

41
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,890
它是爱和慈悲心的栖息地。
the seat of love and compassion.

42
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:39,170
这颗心正是如此的重要。
And it's this heart that is so terribly important.

43
00:04:39,170 --> 00:04:40,760
我是个作家。
I'm a writer.

44
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,120
对我来说，灵感是必不可少的。
For me, inspiration is essential.

45
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:46,500
创造力是必不可少的。
Creativity is essential.

46
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:49,640
而我只有通过心才能找到它们。
And I can only find it through the heart.

47
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,520
更高层次的逻辑和理解
The higher order of logic and understanding

48
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:55,525
源于你的内心。
originates in your heart.

49
00:04:55,525 --> 00:04:58,950
它们是在你的心中所体验到的。
It's experienced in your heart.

50
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,380
它活在你的心里。
It's lived in your heart.

51
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,550
从我们出生到死亡，生理上的心脏
The physical heart pumps blood through the veins and arteries

52
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,600
通过静脉和动脉泵送血液。
from the time we're born until time we die.

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,280
它是有史以来效率最高的泵。
The most efficient pump ever invented.

54
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:12,680
但是，心脏的作用不仅仅如此。
But the heart is more than that.

56
00:05:15,290 --> 00:05:17,370
我们在 HeartMath 做了个实验，
We did an experiment here at HeartMath

57
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:19,410
研究信息如何在
to study how the information flows

58
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,570
心脏和大脑之间流动，实际上我们
between the heart and the brain, and we actually

59
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:23,190
发现了一些非同寻常的东西,
discovered something quite remarkable,

60
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:24,690
让我们大吃一惊的东西。
something that surprised us.

62
00:05:40,850 --> 00:05:42,500
研究中的参与者
The participants in the study were

63
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,120
被连接到各种传感器，
connected to various sensors 

64
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,330
以测量他们的脑电波、心跳等。
to measure their brain waves, their heartbeats, and so on.

65
00:05:47,330 --> 00:05:49,520
然后被展示成各种各样的图像。
And then they were exposed to various images.

66
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,892
有些是高度兴奋的，
Some were high arousal, 

67
00:05:50,892 --> 00:05:53,853
比如车祸，或者是被蛇攻击，
like a car crash, or a snake striking, 

68
00:05:53,853 --> 00:05:55,460
而其它的是低度兴奋的图像，
while others were lower arousal images 

69
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:59,030
如小兔子和自然场景。
like bunny rabbits and nature scenes.

70
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:02,180
参与者被要求按一个按钮。
The participants were asked to push a button.

71
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,270
之后他们看到一个空白的电脑屏幕，持续6秒钟。
They then saw a blank computer screen for six seconds.

72
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:07,160
然后计算机随机选择
The computer then randomly selected

73
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,260
其中一张照片，并显示三秒钟。
one of these photographs that it displayed for three seconds.

74
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,060
之后，屏幕空白10秒,
After that the screen went blank for 10 seconds,

75
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:17,060
并提示他们再次按下按钮，
and they were prompted to push the button again,

76
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:20,060
他们重复了该过程大约30次。
and they repeated this protocol about 30 times.

78
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:27,100
当我们分析所有的数据时，
When we analyzed all the data, 

78
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,930
结果令人震惊。
the results were astounding.

79
00:06:29,930 --> 00:06:32,320
在参与者用眼睛看到图像之前，
The heart seemed to know the images

80
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:37,555
心似乎知道了这些图像。
before the participants ever saw the images with their eyes.

81
00:06:37,555 --> 00:06:39,760
如果将看到的画面是
If the future picture was going to be 

81
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,860
情感激昂的图片之一，
one of the emotionally arousing ones, 

82
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:45,200
在图像随机出现在屏幕
the heart rate started to drop about five seconds

83
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:47,120
之前的五秒钟，
before the image was randomly

84
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,430
心跳开始加速。
selected to be shown on the screen.

85
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:52,140
而没人知道将会出现什么图片。
So nobody could know what this future picture was going to be.

87
00:06:56,860 --> 00:07:00,550
心跳降幅速度要大得多，
The heart had a much greater de-acceleration

88
00:07:00,550 --> 00:07:03,367
而不是一幅平静的画面。
than if it was, say, going to be a calm picture.

90
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,770
实际上，这些结果后来在全世界
These results have since been replicated

91
00:07:09,770 --> 00:07:14,982
许多不同的独立实验室中得到了验证。
in many different independent labs around the world, actually.

93
00:07:14,982 --> 00:07:17,660
很多人说，我心里无感，
Well, a lot of people say that I don't feel it in my heart,

94
00:07:17,660 --> 00:07:18,800
而在内脏中有感。
I feel it in my gut.

95
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,840
但真正发生的情况是这样的。
But here's what's really happening.

96
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:23,170
信息先到达心脏。
The information comes to the heart first.

97
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:24,860
之后心脏会发出不同的信号给大脑，
The heart then sends a different signal

98
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,660
而这些信号我们可以测量得到。
to the brain which we can measure.

99
00:07:26,660 --> 00:07:30,610
然后是你的大脑会有反应再，然后是身体反应。
Then you have a brain response, and then a body response.

100
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:33,580
随着身体的反应，如肠胃有所感觉，
And with the body response, like feeling in the gut, 

101
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:35,220
或者脖子后面的毛发,
or the hair on the back of the neck,

102
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,720
就是它变得有意识的地方。
is where it becomes conscious.

103
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,060
真正的信息流是心脏、大脑、身体。
But the real flow of information is heart, brain, body.

104
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,100
而这一切都发生在
And this is all happening in many seconds

105
00:07:43,100 --> 00:07:46,540
实际事件发生前的许多秒。
before the actual event occurs.

106
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:49,310
因此，这些研究告诉我们的是，
So what this body of research is telling us is 

107
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,430
心脏似乎与一种不受
that the heart seems to be connected to a type of intuition 

108
00:07:52,430 --> 00:07:55,740
时间和空间限制的直觉有关。
that is not bound by the limits of time and space.

110
00:07:55,740 --> 00:07:57,390
但是直觉从何而来呢？
But what is that source of intuition?

111
00:07:57,390 --> 00:08:00,270
心与什么相连，我们怎样才能
What is the heart connected to, and how can we

112
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,860
学会更多地使用它呢？
learn to tap into more of that?

114
00:08:05,614 --> 00:08:07,030
我相信一个与自己的心
I believe that the person who is

115
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:13,460
脱节的人是没有生命可言的。
disconnected from his or her heart is not living.

116
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,760
我知道很多人都有这种感觉，
I know a lot of people who [? felt ?] that 

117
00:08:18,760 --> 00:08:23,950
虽然他们走路、说话、看电视,
but they walk, they talk, they watch television,

118
00:08:23,950 --> 00:08:27,410
有时工作很努力，但心却不在焉。
they work hard sometimes.

119
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:31,360
我们是地球上唯一可以
We're the only living form on Earth

120
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,600
真正变为行尸走肉的生命形式。
that can actually become the walking dead.

121
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:41,320
我们实际上可以切断我们自己的活力来源。
We can actually cut off our own source to aliveness.

122
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:50,710
但不知何故，这种神性能量的火花消失了。
But somehow this spark of divine energy is lost.

123
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:52,820
这事就曾发生在我身上。
This happened to me.

124
00:08:52,820 --> 00:08:55,970
我说，哦，我想成为一个作家。
I said, oh, I want to be a writer.

125
00:08:55,970 --> 00:08:58,970
我的乐队说，哦，来吧，保罗。
My band says, oh come on, Paulo.

126
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:02,330
在巴西，要想成为一名作家很难，
In Brazil, to be a writer in Brazil,

127
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:04,520
没有人能靠写作谋生。
nobody can make a living out of writing.

128
00:09:04,520 --> 00:09:07,880
我说，我不在乎，我只想快乐。
I said, but I don't care, I just want to be happy.

129
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:11,310
我只是想做点能让我开心的事。
I just want to do something that is going to give me fun.

130
00:09:11,310 --> 00:09:13,380
这会让我的人生有意义。
It's going to give a meaning for my life.

131
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,740
他们说，不，不，不，不，不。
And they said, no, no, no, no, no.

132
00:09:15,740 --> 00:09:16,810
然后，当然，
And then, of course, 

132
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:20,900
因为我觉得老年人更有智慧，
because I thought that old people are wiser, 

133
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:24,100
我说，好吧，他们说的有道理。
I said, OK, they have reason.

134
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,160
让我做点别的事情。
Let me do something different.

135
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,460
但我做不了。
But I could not.

136
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:35,680
我离开了大学，我只是... ，我说,
I quit the university to I was only ... and I said,

137
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,900
你必须自断后路。
you have to burn your bridges.

138
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:40,300
我就这样自断后路了。
And I just burned my bridges.

139
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,800
我别无选择，
And I had no choice 

140
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:46,500
只能跟随我想做的事情。
but to follow the thing that I wanted to do.

141
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,810
因此，从我意识到
So from the moment that I realized

142
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:52,670
想成为作家的那一刻起，我说，我要成为一名作家。
that I want to be a writer, I said, I'm going to be a writer.

143
00:09:52,670 --> 00:09:56,880
这可能需要10天，10年，或20年,
It may take 10 days, 10 years, or 20 years,

144
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,050
但我要写作。
but I'm going to write.

145
00:09:58,050 --> 00:10:00,540
于是，我就从为歌曲写歌词开始，
And then I started by writing lyrics for songs,

146
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:06,110
我从为报纸写文章开始。
I start by writing articles for newspapers.

147
00:10:06,110 --> 00:10:09,496
我40岁的时候写了第一本书,
I wrote my first book when I was 40,

148
00:10:09,496 --> 00:10:12,844
但至少我写了我的第一本书。
but at least I wrote my first book.

150
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:21,180
所以最后，如果你不能实现你的梦想,
So at the end, if you don't fulfill your dream,

151
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:26,190
上帝会找到三四种方式敲打你的头，
God finds three, four times a way to kick your head

152
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:28,500
然后对你说，来吧。
and say, come on.

153
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:32,490
不要忘记你人生的使命。
Don't forget your purpose in your life.

154
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:34,090
给自己的梦想一个机会。
Give a chance to your dream.

155
00:10:34,090 --> 00:10:36,165
你不会后悔的。
You are not going to regret.

156
00:10:36,165 --> 00:10:38,123
我不是说你不会受苦。
I'm not saying that you're not going to suffer.

158
00:10:41,010 --> 00:10:44,580
我不是说你不会有挫败。
I'm not saying that you're not going to be defeated.

159
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,820
我是说你不会后悔的。
I'm saying you're not going to go regret it.

160
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:52,620
中世纪的女神秘主义者，梅希尔德说得好，
The medieval female mystic, Mechthild,

161
00:10:52,620 --> 00:10:56,990
她说，鱼不会淹死在水里，
beautifully said that a fish cannot drown in water

162
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,240
鸟也不会从天上掉下来。
and a bird cannot fall from the sky.

163
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:03,770
每种生物都必须找到上天赐予的天赋。
Each creature must find their own God-given element.

164
00:11:03,770 --> 00:11:08,510
对鱼类和鸟类来说，这很容易，它们知道自己的天赋。
And it's easy for fish and birds, they know their element.

165
00:11:08,510 --> 00:11:12,460
但对人类来说，就不那么容易了。
But for human beings it's not so easy.

166
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:15,380
怀着善意，我们总是挣扎于
With well intention, we always struggle

167
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:21,890
是否跟随我们的内心、我们的直接经验
whether to follow our heart and our direct experience

168
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:25,550
以及他人的建议和指导。
and the advice and instruction of others.

169
00:11:25,550 --> 00:11:29,030
无论他们是父母、爱人、朋友，
Whether they be parents, loved ones, friends, 

170
00:11:29,030 --> 00:11:33,080
还是我们所处时代的潮流，
trends in whatever age we're born into.

171
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:38,180
没有什么可以替代我们的心
And there's no substitute for following the aliveness

172
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:41,660
为我们所带来的活力。
that our heart tunes us to.

174
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:48,214
很多时候，人们都在寻找理想的伴侣,
Many times people are looking for their ideal partner,

175
00:11:48,214 --> 00:11:49,630
却说找不到。
and they say they can't find them.

176
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:51,550
他们一直在找啊找啊找啊，
They're looking, and they're looking, and they're looking,

177
00:11:51,550 --> 00:11:52,880
却找不到理想伴侣。
and they can't find them.

178
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:55,900
如果你的灵魂伴侣没有来敲你的门,
Well if your soulmate is not knocking on your door,

179
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,110
并不是说你不够努力。
it's not that you're not looking hard enough.

180
00:11:58,110 --> 00:11:59,360
如果你想找到
If you want to find someone 

181
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,480
能够完全爱你和了解你的伴侣，
that can fully love you and know you, 

181
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:04,120
首先你得了解自己和爱自己。
you have to know and love yourself.

182
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:06,730
当我们能够给自己这种爱，
When we're able to give ourself this kind of love 

183
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:09,110
这意味着我们现在的样子就足够好了，
which says we're good enough just the way we are, 

184
00:12:09,110 --> 00:12:11,950
我们在这个世界上是有原因的，
that we're in this world for a reason,

185
00:12:11,950 --> 00:12:13,530
我们永远不会孤独，
that we're never alone, 

186
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:17,240
这种满足感为与他人
that sense of fulfillment provides a foundation 

187
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:21,190
建立成功的关系提供了基础。
for having a successful relationship with someone else.

188
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,910
一个伟大的老师有如一朵简单的花。
A great teacher this is a simple flower.

189
00:12:24,910 --> 00:12:29,170
花若盛开，蜜蜂自来。
When the flower blossoms, the bee comes.

190
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:33,100
这朵花不会去寻找蜜蜂。
The flower doesn't go looking for the bee.

191
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:35,590
这才是心灵真正鲜活起来的方式,
And this is where the heart really comes alive,

192
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:38,800
因为恋爱关系远比
because relationships are far more challenging 

193
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:41,090
我们在电影中看到的更具挑战性。
than what we see in the movies.

194
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:42,670
好了，开播吧。
All right, roll it.

195
00:12:42,670 --> 00:12:45,168
我一辈子都爱着你。
I've loved you all my life.

196
00:12:45,168 --> 00:12:48,440
但我们才认识两天。
But we only met two days ago.

197
00:12:48,440 --> 00:12:52,080
那是我生命的开始。
That's when my life began.

198
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,640
一段关系的旅程就是
The journey of a relationship is

199
00:12:53,640 --> 00:12:58,980
一次又一次地寻找真爱。
finding love every time again, and again, and again.

200
00:12:58,980 --> 00:13:01,620
一次又一次的寻找真爱意味着
And to find love again and again means

201
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:06,150
你会失去它，失去它，再失去它。
you're going to lose it, and lose it, and lose it.

202
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:09,780
人们常常会问，如果心是如此强大,
Often the question arises that if the heart is so powerful,

203
00:13:09,780 --> 00:13:11,430
为什么人们会感到心碎呢？
why is it so easily broken?

204
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:14,580
我在地球上的日子让我明白,
And my time on Earth has led me to understand,

205
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:17,840
因为那是心成长的方式。
because that's how the heart grows.

206
00:13:17,840 --> 00:13:20,000
就像我们运动时，
In the same way that when we exercise 

206
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,850
我们的肌肉实际上会酸胀疼痛，
our muscles actually break down 

207
00:13:22,850 --> 00:13:26,850
这样它们才能变得更健康更强壮,
so that they can get healthy and grow stronger,

208
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:28,710
心也是这样运作的。
this is how the heart works.

209
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,360
你必须不断克服重重阻碍,
You have to bring forth obstacles,

210
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,890
这就是婚姻的意义所在。
and that's what a marriage is.

211
00:13:31,890 --> 00:13:33,240
你将面临挑战。
You will be challenged.

212
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:36,760
一天，一个金发女郎走进了查尔斯的生活。
One day a blonde walked into Charles' life.

213
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,703
她真的漂亮吗？
Was she really pretty?

214
00:13:38,703 --> 00:13:41,700
好吧，我对她撒谎，但玛丽安也看到了她。
Well, I'd lie about her, but Marian saw her, too.

215
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:42,960
是的，她很漂亮。
Yes, she's very pretty.

216
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:45,120
有时候你会怀疑你的伴侣,
There'll be times when you doubt your partner,

217
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:46,870
你怀疑你们的关系，
you doubt your relationship, 

217
00:13:46,870 --> 00:13:48,270
你对你的伴侣很生气。
and you're angry with your partner.

218
00:13:48,270 --> 00:13:50,390
你身上没有半点好。
There isn't the slightest bit of good in you.

219
00:13:50,390 --> 00:13:52,620
你害怕接近你的伴侣,
You're afraid to get close to your partner,

220
00:13:52,620 --> 00:13:54,240
你被你的伴侣伤害过。
you've been hurt by your partner.

221
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:56,580
他有事瞒着我，希尔维。
He's hiding something from me, Sylvie.

222
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,870
发生了一些可怕的事。
Something terrible.

223
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,520
这是旅程的一部分。
This is part of that journey.

224
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:04,710
在这样心碎的时刻，是痛苦的,
You know, in the moment of such breaking, it's agony,

225
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,760
我们感到绝望。
and we feel desperate.

226
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,130
但是心，只是说，给我更多。
But the heart, the heart just says, give me more.

227
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:13,650
给我多一点。
Give me more.

228
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:16,980
当你回到爱中，每次回到爱中,
As you come back to love, each time coming back to love,

229
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,530
寻求宽恕，寻求接纳，
finding forgiveness, finding acceptance, 

230
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,970
甚至有时会感谢你的伴侣的不足之处，
even thanking your partner at times for their inadequacies

231
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,280
可以这么说，因为它在你自己身上
so to speak, because it poured forth

232
00:14:26,280 --> 00:14:29,870
倾泻出更大的爱，这就是你成长的方式。
greater love within yourself, that is how you grow.

233
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,900
确实有过一场战斗。
There was a battle, all right.

234
00:14:31,900 --> 00:14:35,700
但我不是与保罗开战，而是与我自己。
But it wasn't Paul I had to fight, but myself.

235
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,900
邦妮会对我说，约翰，
Bonnie will say to me, John, 

236
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,700
我不想听你的，
I don't want to listen to you 

237
00:14:39,700 --> 00:14:42,610
除非你从心里跟我说话。
until you're talking to me from your heart.

238
00:14:42,610 --> 00:14:44,460
我说，不，我在说话，我说得有道理。
I said, no, I'm talking, I'm making sense.

239
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,540
邦妮说，不。
No.

240
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,190
我想听听你的感受。
I want to hear your feeling.

241
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,690
我想从你的语气中听到你的爱。
I want to hear your love in the tone of your voice.

242
00:14:49,690 --> 00:14:52,530
当你能找到它时，我们可以再次交谈。
And when you can find it, we can talk again.

243
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:54,420
她给我的信息多么简单明了啊！
What a simple message she gives me.

244
00:14:54,420 --> 00:14:55,950
如果她说我脑子有问题，
Now, it would be a mistake for her

245
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:58,830
这对她来说是个错误，
to say something's wrong with being in my head,

246
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:01,570
因为那会让我犯下很大的错误。
because that would make a very important part of me wrong.

247
00:15:01,570 --> 00:15:03,420
但她有时会说
But what she'll say is at times what

248
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,480
我的心是关闭的，当我听起来很刻薄或
my heart is closed, when I sound mean

249
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,766
或者专注于做正确的事时...
or focused on being right...

250
00:15:07,766 --> 00:15:10,140
现在，如果你想告诉我是什么困扰着你，没问题。
Now, if you want to tell me what's troubling you, fine.

251
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:13,140
如果没有，我累了，很晚了，我想回家睡觉。
If not, I'm tired, it's late, and I want to go home to bed.

252
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:15,630
她会说，现在，我听不下去了。
She'll say, right now, I can't hear this.

253
00:15:15,630 --> 00:15:18,390
我需要多听听你的心声。
I need to hear a little bit more of your heart.

254
00:15:18,390 --> 00:15:20,310
当你准备好说心里话的时候，
When you're ready to talk from your heart,

255
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:22,110
我就准备好与你交谈了。
I'm ready to talk with you.

256
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,760
我认为我们这个时代的挑战
I think the challenge in our age

257
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:25,500
就是保持好关系。
is staying in a relationship.

258
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,890
这并不意味着要继续一段虐待性的关系
And that doesn't mean to stay in abusive relationships

259
00:15:28,890 --> 00:15:30,810
或者没有结果的关系中。
or relationships that don't work.

260
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:32,980
我发现对我来说，
And I have found for me that 

261
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:37,190
在一段友谊或
the difference often as to whether to stay or go 

261
00:15:37,190 --> 00:15:40,780
或爱情关系中是去是留，
in a friendship or a love relationship

262
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:45,715
往往取决于我的所有身份是否受到欢迎。
hinges on whether all of who I am is welcome.

264
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:50,120
如果有人要求我放弃自我
If I am asked to leave who I am 

264
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:53,600
或者放弃自我的一部分,
or part of who I am outside,

265
00:15:54,100 --> 00:15:58,440
那么不管我们在这段关系中做了什么,
then no matter what we do in that relationship,

266
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,330
我都不会成长的。
I won't grow.

267
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,270
因为我不能和我的心持有联系。
Because I won't be able to stay connected to my heart.

268
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:07,270
这就是他们的故事真正开始的地方。
And this is where their story really begins.

269
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:10,780
告诉你结局会很不公平，因为我们希望
It wouldn't be fair to tell you how it ends, for that, we hope,

270
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:13,474
这是你想亲自体验的事情。
is something you'll want to experience for yourself.

272
00:16:27,130 --> 00:16:29,480
事情会变得很疯狂，不是吗？
Things can get crazy, no?

273
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:33,640
很多人，他们失去了孩子，
So many people, they lose their kids

274
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:36,690
因为其中没有关系，
because there is no relationship,

275
00:16:36,690 --> 00:16:37,780
没有联系。
there is no contact.

276
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:42,280
这是非常糟糕的，因为没有机会再试一次，
Which is very bad, because no time to try again,

277
00:16:42,280 --> 00:16:44,560
再试一次并找到解决办法。
and to try again, to find a solution.

278
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:45,400
我有四个孩子。
I have four kids.

279
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:47,770
他们中的一个正在打桌球。
One of them is playing for [? IX. ?] 

280
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:49,590
大概我更关注这个孩子。
Probably I paid more attention to that.

281
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:52,870
而最大的那个就没那么受关注了,
And then the oldest one got a little bit less attention,

282
00:16:52,870 --> 00:16:57,790
我不知道，他在某种程度上与我做对。
I don't know, and he was against me in a way.

283
00:16:57,790 --> 00:17:00,090
于是我决定，我必须做点什么。
And I decided, I have to do something.

284
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:03,040
我必须给自己一个接近他的机会。
I have to give him an opportunity to get closer.

285
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:06,154
后来，我突然告诉他，来吧。
And then all of a sudden I told him, come on.

286
00:17:06,154 --> 00:17:09,390
拿上包包，我们去希腊吧！
We take the bags and we'll go to Greece, you know.

287
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:14,390
为了说服他，我说，这可能是我最后一次。
I said, in order to persuade him, it might be my last time.

288
00:17:14,390 --> 00:17:16,020
他说，你为什么这么说？
Why did you say that?

289
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:19,264
我对他说，当我们登上阿尔卑斯山，我会告诉你。
When we go up on the Alps I will tell you.

290
00:17:19,264 --> 00:17:20,430
我没什么可告诉他的。
I had nothing to tell him.

291
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:22,700
我这样告诉他，是因为不然他不会来,
I just told him because otherwise he wouldn't come,

292
00:17:22,700 --> 00:17:25,250
我知道他不会来。
and I knew that he wouldn't come.

293
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:28,175
我们从阿姆斯特丹去了希腊雅典。
We went from Amsterdam, to Athens, Greece.

295
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:37,420
我成为他的兄弟，成为他的伴侣,
You become his brother, you become his mate,

296
00:17:37,420 --> 00:17:40,630
成了他的朋友。
you become his friend.

297
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:43,520
这事发生在阿尔卑斯山，那里是零下16度，
This would happen up in the Alps, where it was minus 16

298
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:47,634
我们都冻僵了，所以我们成了一体。
and we're freezing cold, so we became one.

299
00:17:47,634 --> 00:17:49,582
嘿，你在哪，伙计？
Hey, where are you, man?

300
00:17:49,582 --> 00:17:50,753
爸爸，你在哪？
Dad, where are you?

301
00:17:50,753 --> 00:17:52,345
这里有个小房子，来吧！
This is a little house here, come!

303
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,550
你好？
Hello?

304
00:17:57,550 --> 00:17:58,660
你好。
Hello.

305
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,460
嘿！
Hey!

306
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:03,620
求你了，让我们今晚和你一起睡吧。
Look at this, please, please let us sleep with you tonight.

307
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:06,400
不知道你是否允许我和威廉今晚睡在这里，
If you allow me to sleep here tonight, me and Willem,

308
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,270
就一晚上。
just for a night.

309
00:18:07,270 --> 00:18:08,632
天太冷了。
It's so cold.

310
00:18:08,632 --> 00:18:10,250
我爱你。
I love you.

311
00:18:10,250 --> 00:18:13,370
然后我们之间所有的摩擦都消失了，
And then everything went away all this friction

312
00:18:13,370 --> 00:18:16,770
因为我和他的心连在了一起。
because I was in the same team with him.

313
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:20,660
我喜欢这样，我很高兴这个小错误，
And I love that, and I'm very happy that this little mistake

314
00:18:20,660 --> 00:18:23,210
没有把足够的时间
of mine, which was not dedicating

315
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:24,880
花在我的大儿子身上...
enough time to my oldest son...

316
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,656
我对拳击一窍不通,
I don't know nothing about boxing,

317
00:18:26,656 --> 00:18:28,310
所以照顾一下你爸爸，好吗？
so be careful with your dad, eh?

318
00:18:28,310 --> 00:18:31,360
现在我们是非常非常好的朋友。
And now that we are really, really good friends.

320
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,640
每个父亲和他的儿子都会有不少摩擦。
Every father has good friction with his son.

321
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,700
而且他们喜欢这种摩擦。
And love it.

322
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:41,440
你有好孩子，不是吗？
You have good kids, no?

323
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:44,110
当摩擦来临时，我希望你会喜欢。
I hope you will enjoy when the friction is coming.

324
00:18:44,110 --> 00:18:46,406
否则他就没有性格了。
Otherwise he hasn't got any character.

325
00:18:46,406 --> 00:18:47,730
你没事吧？
You OK?

326
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,890
是啊，伙计。
Yeah, man.

327
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:51,713
所以当你儿子和你作对时，要非常高兴。
So when your son is against you, be very happy.

328
00:18:51,713 --> 00:18:52,513
好吗？
OK?

330
00:18:58,190 --> 00:19:03,830
9月22日星期天，晚上10点54分左右,
On Sunday, September 22nd, at about 10:54 in the evening,

331
00:19:03,830 --> 00:19:07,850
我们的女儿在从科罗拉多州立大学奇科州立图书馆骑自行车回家时，
our daughter was riding her bicycle home from the CSU Chico

332
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:13,880
被一个醉酒的司机撞了，
State Library when she was struck by a drunk driver

333
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:18,400
然后被丢在路边等死。
and left on the side of the road to die.

334
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,510
在和护士的电话交谈中,
In the phone conversation with the nurse,

335
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:25,330
我们知道她出了车祸,
we knew that she had been in an accident,

336
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:28,650
但我们不知道任何细节。
but we didn't know any of the details.

337
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:33,650
说是个酒后驾车的司机，还说是个19岁的孩子。
That it was a drunk driver, and that it was a 19-year-old kid.

338
00:19:33,650 --> 00:19:36,430
她当时正在离学校四个街区远的地方骑车回家。
She was riding four blocks home from school.

339
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:38,890
她离她的公寓只有半个街区。
She was about a half a block from her apartment.

340
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:41,360
从她被撞击的地方可以看到她的公寓。
You could see her apartment from where she was hit.

341
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,510
你可以站在桥上，
You could actually stand on the bridge

342
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,930
从那里看她的公寓。
and see her apartment from there.

343
00:19:44,930 --> 00:19:45,730
她差一点就到公寓了。
She was so close.

344
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,536
就是这么近，我已经站在那里很多次了，
That's how close it was, and I've stood there so many times

345
00:19:48,536 --> 00:19:49,910
只是看着那个距离。
and just looked at that distance.

347
00:19:56,290 --> 00:20:01,760
想到短短的距离改变了我们的生活。
Just thought about that short distance has changed our lives.

349
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,650
克里斯蒂娜是你不常
Christina was one of those extraordinary people

350
00:20:07,650 --> 00:20:10,260
遇到的非凡人物之一。
that you don't come across very often.

351
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:11,554
她喜欢学习。
She studied.

352
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:13,470
她真的想过如何活出生命。
She really thought about how to live her life.

353
00:20:13,470 --> 00:20:15,720
她不像许多人那样在生活中
She didn't just stumble through life

354
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:19,610
跌跌撞撞，尤其是在她这个年纪。
the way many people do, especially at her age.

355
00:20:19,610 --> 00:20:24,020
从她体重足以献血开始，她就献血了。
From the time she weighed enough to give blood, she gave it.

356
00:20:24,020 --> 00:20:26,580
有时她甚至会昏倒,
And sometimes she would even pass out,

357
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,830
桑德拉会开车送她回家，对她说,
and Sandra would drive her home in the car, she'd say,

358
00:20:28,830 --> 00:20:30,750
你不能再献血了，不能再这么做了。
that's it, you're not going to do this again.

359
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:34,580
她说，不，我要再献一次。她献了。
She'd say, no, I am going to do this again and she would.

360
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:38,150
她一有机会就会献血。
She would give blood whenever she had the chance and..

361
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:39,650
每次都晕过去。
Pass out every time.

362
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:42,464
她几乎每次都会晕过去。
And she'd pass out almost every time.

363
00:20:42,464 --> 00:20:43,880
这就是她的生活方式。
That's the way she lived her life.

364
00:20:43,880 --> 00:20:46,924
如果她认为这么做是对的，她就会做。
If she thought it was the right thing to do, she did it.

365
00:20:46,924 --> 00:20:48,840
很多人都知道该做什么,
And so many people know the right thing to do,

366
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,630
但他们并不总是这么做。
but they don't always do it.

367
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:54,030
但她根本不用考虑。
But she didn't even have to think about it.

368
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:56,560
克里斯蒂娜去世后三周左右,
About three weeks after Christina died,

369
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:02,020
我们得去收拾她在奇科的公寓。
we had to go and pack up her apartment up in Chico.

370
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:07,960
我打开抽屉，看到一个化妆包。
And I opened up a drawer and I saw a makeup bag.

371
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:10,310
我打开了化妆包，
I opened up the makeup bag 

372
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:12,510
看到里面有几张纸。
and it had several pieces of paper in it.

373
00:21:12,510 --> 00:21:16,530
里面没有化妆品，只有几张纸。
No makeup, but several pieces of paper.

374
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:21,480
在那些纸中有一张纸，
And among those papers was this piece of paper

375
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,740
是折叠起来的，有点破旧。
that was folded and a little tattered.

376
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:28,820
我看着它，开始阅读。
And I looked at it and I started to read.

377
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:31,550
我认出这是遗愿清单。
And I realized it was bucket list.

379
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:55,615
她从没说过想发财，或想出名。
She never said I want to be rich, I want to be famous.

380
00:21:55,615 --> 00:21:59,900
她没有提出任何不合理的要求。
She didn't ask for anything unreasonable.

381
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:02,665
她只想做些正常的事，
She just wanted to do normal stuff

382
00:22:02,665 --> 00:22:04,597
而从来没有机会这么做。
and she never got to do that.

384
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,890
同时出现在四个地方。
Be in four places at once.

385
00:22:10,890 --> 00:22:13,050
有个地方叫四角。
There's a place called Four Corners.

386
00:22:13,050 --> 00:22:16,210
你实际上可以来到四个州边缘处，
You can actually go to the edge of all four states, 

387
00:22:16,210 --> 00:22:18,200
那是她想做的事。
that's what she wanted to do.

388
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,150
但她已经这么做了。
But she's done this already.

389
00:22:21,150 --> 00:22:26,340
不是因为她在场，而是因为她的器官。
Not by being there, but with her organs.

390
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:30,330
她的器官捐给了四个人，而这四个人到了这四个地方。
Parts of her are four places at once.

391
00:22:30,330 --> 00:22:32,910
她的肝脏切割后捐给了两个人。
Her liver was split between two people.

392
00:22:32,910 --> 00:22:37,190
其中一个是55岁的男人，另一个是9个月大的婴儿。
One was a 55-year-old man and one was a nine-month-old baby.

393
00:22:37,190 --> 00:22:40,130
一个肾脏，捐给了一个他们家认识的人。
A kidney, somebody that the family knew.

394
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,980
另一个人得到了克里斯蒂娜剩下的肝脏。
Another man got the rest of Christina's liver.

395
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:46,200
她的胰腺和另一个肾
Her pancreas and the other kidney 

396
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,620
捐给了一个住在南湾的男人。
went to a man in the South Bay.

397
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,090
她的心脏捐给了一个来自斯坦福大学
And her heart went to a 64-year-old woman

398
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,475
住在南湾的64岁的女人。
from the South Bay at Stanford.

400
00:23:00,245 --> 00:23:05,340
老子说我只有三样东西教导：
Lao Tzu said that I have just three things to teach：

401
00:23:05,340 --> 00:23:11,410
简单、耐心和慈悲心。
simplicity, patience, and compassion.

402
00:23:11,410 --> 00:23:15,460
在一个我们逃避内心
In an age where we run from the depth of feeling

403
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:17,870
深处的感受和教导的时代，
and the teachings of the heart, 

404
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:23,740
我们的恐惧会重新定义简单为愚蠢,
our fear can reframe simplicity as stupidity,

405
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:30,100
耐心为懒惰，慈悲为多愁善感。
patience as laziness, and compassion as sentimentality.

406
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:35,500
因此，觉得它们不值得实践。
And therefore make them not worthwhile to pick up.

407
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:42,860
简单意指直接体验生活，获得第一手的经验。
Simplicity refers to direct living, firsthand experience.

408
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:48,550
回归到直接触碰生活。
So the return to touching life directly.

409
00:23:48,550 --> 00:23:53,080
这可以恢复我们的身心完整。
This restores our wholeheartedness.

410
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,700
耐心也使我们恢复身心完整。
Patience also restores us to wholeheartedness.

411
00:23:57,700 --> 00:24:05,110
我们一直感到的紧迫感大多是虚假的。
The urgencies we feel ever present are mostly false.

412
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:10,510
除非你我不能呼吸或者在流血,
Unless you or I can't breathe or we're bleeding,

413
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:13,050
其实没什么大不了的。
there's no real urgency.

414
00:24:13,050 --> 00:24:16,260
慈悲，从字面上来说，
And compassion, compassion literally

415
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:21,450
意指真诚地与人相处。
means to be with, to keep honest company.

416
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:29,230
因此，当我没有直接体验生活时，当我没有耐心时,
So when I am not directly living, when I am not patient,

417
00:24:29,230 --> 00:24:32,590
我想解决你的痛苦，
I want to problem solve your pain

418
00:24:32,590 --> 00:24:34,650
而不是陪着你。
and not keep you company with it.

420
00:24:37,334 --> 00:24:38,750
经常有人问我，道理上都说得通，
I'm often asked, well that's fine,

421
00:24:38,750 --> 00:24:42,920
但是在现实世界中我们怎么才能做到呢？
but how can we do that in the real world?

422
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,000
我不这么认为。
And I see it differently.

423
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:54,050
我开始明白如果你不敞开心扉,
I've come to understand that if you don't open your heart,

424
00:24:54,050 --> 00:24:56,830
那么现实就会碾压你。
then existence will crush you.

425
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,020
不是因为存在有什么邪恶的东西，
Not because there's something evil about existence,

426
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:01,960
就像水可以填满一个洞，
but because the way water fills a hole,

427
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:08,260
如果你不以你自己的身份去迎接这个世界，
if you don't meet the world with who you are then

428
00:25:08,260 --> 00:25:11,050
那么周围的一切就会把你填满。
everything around will just fill you in.

429
00:25:11,050 --> 00:25:14,500
所以总有一个问题，是的，如果我在外面的世界,
So there's always a question, yes, if I'm out in the world,

430
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:17,860
我可能会受伤，可能会被人利用。
I could get hurt, I could get taken advantage of.

431
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,680
我可能会被人背叛。
I could get betrayed.

432
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:23,420
我的信任可能得不到回报。
My trust may not be rewarded.

433
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,770
这些都是真的。
This is all true.

434
00:25:25,770 --> 00:25:29,470
但我发现，不保持敞开心扉、
But I have found that the cost for not staying

435
00:25:29,470 --> 00:25:33,800
全心全意的代价是，
open hearted, whole hearted, is that 

436
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:37,915
我失去了对自己生命力的接触。
I lose access to my aliveness.

437
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:41,770
我们最终将步入一个
And we'll end up walking lock step

438
00:25:41,770 --> 00:25:48,950
消费主义、获取、恐惧和担忧的社会。
in a society of consumerism, of getting, of fear, and of worry.

439
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:52,510
我们不会活出自己的人生。
And we will not have lived our life.

440
00:25:52,510 --> 00:25:54,460
我们要过自己的人生。
We have a life to live.

441
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:56,540
我们的心有答案。
The heart has the answers.

443
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:06,410
我是一家杂志的编辑，一年前就职。
I was editor of a magazine, I started that one years ago.

444
00:26:06,410 --> 00:26:08,120
我在看这本杂志。
And I was looking at this magazine.

445
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,740
和往常一样，
And as usual, there was this picture

446
00:26:09,740 --> 00:26:11,750
杂志前还有这张编辑的照片。
of the editor in front of the magazine.

447
00:26:11,750 --> 00:26:15,770
我看着自己，微笑着，我想,
And I was looking at myself smiling, and I thought,

448
00:26:15,770 --> 00:26:17,690
这不是真的。
it's not true.

449
00:26:17,690 --> 00:26:18,980
这不是我。
This is not me.

450
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,680
但是有一种悲伤，就像一股
But there was a sadness, it was like a wave

451
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:24,080
悲伤的浪潮冲刷着我。
of sadness that washed me.

452
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,880
那一刻我真的很难过。
It was a really upset moment.

453
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,100
我现在可以笑了。
I can laugh at it now.

454
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:30,200
我想，这个我，或自我是谁？
And I thought, who is this me, or I, or self?

455
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:34,190
在宗教或灵性传统,
What is it in religion, or in spiritual traditions,

456
00:26:34,190 --> 00:26:35,820
或哲学中，我是什么？
or in philosophy?

457
00:26:35,820 --> 00:26:37,940
它是什么？
What is it?

458
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:40,580
历史上所有的灵性传统
Every spiritual tradition throughout history

459
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:44,480
都将心视为灵魂的种子。
has spoken about the heart as being the seed of the soul.

460
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:47,690
心中的金刚，心中的莲花，
The diamond in the heart, the lotus and the heart,

461
00:26:47,690 --> 00:26:50,000
心中的殿堂。
the temple in the heart.

462
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:52,610
每个传统都讲心
Every tradition speaks about the heart

463
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:57,190
是我们的本质。
as being the essence of who we are.

464
00:26:57,190 --> 00:27:02,200
心指向你内在最重要的维度。
The heart points to the most essential dimension within you.

465
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:05,250
活在这种联系中,
So to live in connectedness with that,

466
00:27:05,250 --> 00:27:09,310
那么你就接触到了心灵的力量
then you are in touch with the power of the heart, which

467
00:27:09,310 --> 00:27:14,260
它也是生命本身的力量。
is the power of life itself.

468
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:17,560
智慧的力量遍及整个宇宙，
The power of the very intelligence

469
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:23,230
并奠定了整个宇宙的基础。
that pervades and underlies the entire universe.

470
00:27:23,230 --> 00:27:26,800
神圣的智慧在你的心中。
Divine intelligence is in your heart.

471
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:30,060
你不会在你的智力中找到你的灵魂。
You will not find your soul in your intellect.

472
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:33,470
我突然想到，哇，看看这些笔记。
And I suddenly thought, wow, look at all these notes.

473
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:35,580
这可能是一本杂志。
This could be a magazine.

474
00:27:35,580 --> 00:27:39,596
标题很简单，因为它让我很开心。
And the title was easy, because it made me really happy.

475
00:27:39,596 --> 00:27:40,580
感到很幸福。
Happiness.

477
00:28:01,260 --> 00:28:05,900
倾听自己的内心可能非常可怕的,
So to listen to your heart can be very frightening,

478
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,730
因为你可能会失去所有
because you might have to lose all the secure things that 

479
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:14,210
生活给你的安全的东西，比如车、钱、房子和一切东西。
life was giving you, like cars, money, houses, everything.

480
00:28:14,210 --> 00:28:17,610
我是个非常害怕的人。
Well, I'm a person who has a lot of fear.

481
00:28:17,610 --> 00:28:21,110
比如说，每次我
Like for example, every time that I

482
00:28:21,110 --> 00:28:23,960
不得不写一本新书。
have to write a new book.

483
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:27,600
我会担心我能充分表达自己吗？
Would I be able to express myself?

484
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:30,340
我能分享我的灵魂吗？
Would I be able to share my soul?

485
00:28:30,340 --> 00:28:33,870
当我们考虑挑战恐惧时,
When we consider challenging fear,

486
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:37,620
我们实际上是在考虑将觉照之光
we're actually considering shining the light of awareness

487
00:28:37,620 --> 00:28:40,830
照射到我们内心那些恐惧的地方。
on those places within us that are fearful.

488
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:43,180
恐惧并没有什么错。
There is nothing wrong with fear.

489
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:47,340
唯一错误的就是被恐惧所麻痹。
The only thing that is wrong is to be paralyzed by fear.

490
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:51,960
所以我想，好吧，我面对这种恐惧，我只是面对它。
So I thought, OK, I face it, I just face it, this fear.

491
00:28:51,960 --> 00:28:56,180
如果这本杂志不成功，我会怎么样？
What will happen to me if this magazine is not a success?

492
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,252
也许我得把房子卖了。
Maybe I have to sell the house.

493
00:28:58,252 --> 00:28:59,460
所以我找了另一栋房子。
So I looked to another house.

495
00:29:02,561 --> 00:29:08,060
在村子里你可以租到很便宜的房子住。
An area in the village where you can rent a very cheap house.

496
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,300
我想，我能住在那里吗？
I thought, can I live there?

497
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:11,600
我当然可以住在那里。
Of course I can live there.

498
00:29:11,600 --> 00:29:12,400
为什么不呢？
Why not?

499
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,700
有屋顶，有房间，我可以住在那里。
It's a roof, it's a house, I can live there.

500
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:17,170
我知道我能处理好。
And I knew I can handle this.

501
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:20,290
不管发生什么，我们都会活下去。
Whatever will happen, we will live.

502
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:22,180
苏族有句老话，
And there's an old Sioux saying

503
00:29:22,180 --> 00:29:26,610
也就是说，你一生中最长的旅程，
that says, the longest journey you will make in your life

504
00:29:26,610 --> 00:29:30,480
是从你的头到你的心。
is from your head to your heart.

505
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:36,870
这不是因为我们愚蠢或者迟钝。
And this isn't because we're stupid or we're slow.

506
00:29:36,870 --> 00:29:41,040
因为这需要时间。
It's because it takes time.

507
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:43,830
在我得癌症之前，我相信心，
Before I had cancer, I believed in the heart

508
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:46,390
但我活在脑中。
but I was living it from my head.

509
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,470
那段旅程，就像融入地下的雪,
And that journey, like snow melting into the ground,

510
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:54,890
我生命的精华融入了我的心。
the essence of my life melted into my heart.

511
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:58,630
我几乎是死里逃生，才完成了
It took almost dying to make that journey 

512
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:02,380
从脑到心的这段旅程。
from my head to my heart.

513
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:05,230
你的初衷应该是
Your primary intention needs to be

514
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:09,970
此时此刻与心的联系。
connectedness with the heart at this moment.

515
00:30:09,970 --> 00:30:14,380
我必须出于好意才行动。
I have to act from a place of good intention.

516
00:30:14,380 --> 00:30:17,710
从一个充满爱和仁慈的地方开始，
A place of love and kindness that

517
00:30:17,710 --> 00:30:20,740
会让我行走在这个世界上
will allow me to walk in this world

518
00:30:20,740 --> 00:30:23,590
而不造成任何损害。
without creating any damage.

519
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:26,920
你可能想要一百万美元,
You may intend to have a million dollars,

520
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:32,603
达成这个目的可能就需要你去抢银行。
and that intention then needs you to rob a bank.

522
00:30:36,270 --> 00:30:40,200
如果你真的想要这个东西，你可以直面内心，说,
If you really want the thing, go to the heart and say,

523
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,110
这就是我想要的。
this is what I want.

524
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,360
心会说，我会告诉你如何得到它。
And the heart can say, I'll show you how you get it.

525
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:49,980
你现在必须愿意去工作，相信我。
You must be willing to work, now, and trust me, now.

526
00:30:49,980 --> 00:30:53,040
然后你就可以拥有它了，是的。
And then you can have it, yes.

527
00:30:53,040 --> 00:30:55,650
如果不会伤害到其他人的话。
If it's not going to hurt anyone else.

528
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:58,240
假设你遇到一个人说,
Suppose you meet someone who says,

529
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,820
我打算赚更多的钱。
I intend to make more money.

530
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:02,400
他说，这就是我的意图。
And he says, that's my intention.

531
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:06,190
你可以问他，为什么你想赚更多的钱？
You can ask him, why do you want to make more money?

532
00:31:06,190 --> 00:31:10,350
然后你会开始了解到一些有趣的东西。
And then you'll start to learn some interesting things.

533
00:31:10,350 --> 00:31:13,110
如果赚钱成为你的首要目标,
If making money becomes your primary goal,

534
00:31:13,110 --> 00:31:16,260
那么要知道你与你自己
then know that you are not connected

535
00:31:16,260 --> 00:31:18,420
最深处的维度没有联结，
with the deepest dimension in yourself

536
00:31:18,420 --> 00:31:21,180
我们称之为心。
that we call the heart.

537
00:31:21,180 --> 00:31:25,680
即使你实现了目标，赚了很多钱,
And even if you achieve your goal and make a lot of money,

538
00:31:25,680 --> 00:31:28,890
你会发现它最终会导致
you will find that ultimately it leads

539
00:31:28,890 --> 00:31:32,190
沮丧和不幸。
to frustration and unhappiness.

540
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:37,290
实现你的梦想，钱肯定会来。
Fulfill your dream, and certainly money may come.

541
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:42,030
如果钱不来，能过上快乐的生活也非常好。
If money does not come, just to have a life full of joy.

542
00:31:42,030 --> 00:31:44,100
以我为例，我从没想过
In my case, for example, I never thought

543
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:47,760
我会以写作为生。
I would make a living out of writing.

544
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:51,840
我写作是因为我想写作。
I was writing because I wanted to do it.

545
00:31:51,840 --> 00:31:53,640
我别无选择。
I had no choice.

546
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,280
所以到最后，
So at the end of the day, 

547
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:58,090
我不仅靠写作赚钱，
not only I made money out of writing, 

548
00:31:58,090 --> 00:32:02,310
而且我靠写作赚了很多钱。
but I made a lot of money out of writing.

549
00:32:02,310 --> 00:32:07,230
经常发生的情况是，当你的行动变得有能力
It often happens that when your actions become empowered

550
00:32:07,230 --> 00:32:13,800
并为这个世界做出了重要贡献时，
and contribute something vital to this world,

551
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:17,860
然后某种形式的富足，
then abundance in some form and 

552
00:32:17,860 --> 00:32:19,750
可能是以金钱的形式，
it may be in the form of money, 

552
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:22,710
有时就会流向你。
can sometimes flow to you.

553
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:24,630
这是一个巨大的成功。
It was a great success.

554
00:32:24,630 --> 00:32:27,950
荷兰希望这本杂志能够发展壮大，
Holland wanted this magazine so it could grow,

555
00:32:27,950 --> 00:32:30,600
它是荷兰最大的杂志。
and it was the biggest magazine of the Netherlands.

556
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,750
这是发自内心的。
It came from the heart.

557
00:32:31,750 --> 00:32:34,200
是真的。
It was the real thing.

558
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:40,110
无论你的心在哪里，你都会找到你的宝藏。
Wherever your heart is, there you will find your treasure.

559
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:45,050
心就是你。
The heart is who you are.

560
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:49,410
心定义了你。
The heart defines you.

561
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:55,900
我真的很想见见那个人,
And I really wanted to meet that person,

562
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:58,660
因为我知道那个人必须非常特别
because I knew that person had to be pretty special 

563
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:03,410
才能得到克里斯蒂娜的心脏。
to get Christina's heart.

564
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:07,760
一天深夜，我儿子收到一个朋友发来的短信,
Late one evening, my son got a text message from a friend,

565
00:33:07,760 --> 00:33:11,300
说，让你妈妈看看脸书主页。
and said, tell your mom to read the Facebook page.

566
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:14,000
于是我登陆脸书网站，看到了一条信息。
So I went to Facebook, and I saw a message.

567
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,090
这条信息是，我是苏珊·维埃拉,
And the message was, I am Susan Vieira,

568
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:20,330
我相信我是你女儿心脏的接受者。
and I believe I'm the recipient of your daughter's heart.

569
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:24,740
我知道时间很晚了，但我还是想给她发个短信。
I knew it was late, but I just figured I'd message her anyway.

570
00:33:24,740 --> 00:33:27,100
她收到短信后马上回应了。
And she responded right back.

571
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:32,431
我拨了她的号码，她接了。
And I dialed her number, and she picked up.

572
00:33:32,431 --> 00:33:34,780
我立刻感觉到了一种联系。
And right away I just felt a connection.

574
00:33:38,084 --> 00:33:41,400
我感觉到了克里斯蒂娜。
I felt Christina.

575
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,850
后来我听说她是个退休护士,
And then when I heard this she was a retired nurse,

576
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:47,660
她们有很多共同点,
and that they had so much in common,

577
00:33:47,660 --> 00:33:51,530
就像克里斯蒂娜亲手挑选了苏珊
that it was like Christina handpicked Susan

578
00:33:51,530 --> 00:33:53,090
来得到她的心脏一样。
to get her heart.

579
00:33:53,090 --> 00:33:56,300
克里斯蒂娜和我都是护士。
Christina and I were both nurses.

580
00:33:56,300 --> 00:34:00,650
我看到了遗愿清单，那真的是我人生的一份简历。
I saw the bucket list, and it's really a CV of my life.

581
00:34:00,650 --> 00:34:03,140
她想管理和拥有自己的企业。
She wanted to manage and own her own business.

582
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:04,310
是的，我做到了。
Yes, I did that.

583
00:34:04,310 --> 00:34:05,660
她想结婚。
She wanted to get married.

584
00:34:05,660 --> 00:34:07,940
是的，我做到了。
Yes, I've done that.

585
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:10,050
她想学开飞机。
She wanted to learn how to fly a plane.

586
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:11,540
我学会了开飞机。
I've learned to fly a plane.

587
00:34:11,540 --> 00:34:14,210
她想去世界七大
She wanted to go to four out of seven

588
00:34:14,210 --> 00:34:16,460
奇迹中的四个所在地。
of the wonders of the world.

589
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:17,750
是的，完成。
Yes, check.

00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:20,160
在飞机上坐头等舱。
Fly first class on an airplane.

591
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,960
完成。

拜访50个州。
Visit the 50 states.

593
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,659
我正在努力。
I'm working on it.

594
00:34:23,659 --> 00:34:25,760
乘坐热气球。
Ride in a hot air balloon.

595
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:26,659
我做到了。
I've done that.

596
00:34:26,659 --> 00:34:28,190
去跳伞。
Go parachuting.

597
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,550
这项清单我得再等等。
I'm going to have to wait a while on that one.

598
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,460
骑骆驼。
Ride a camel.

599
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:32,260
做到了。
Done that.

600
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,040
去所有的大陆旅行。
Travel to all the continents.

601
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:35,000
正在进行中。
Working on it.

602
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:36,980
作为笑脸女孩而被铭记。
Be remembered as the smiley girl.

603
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:39,080
这项清单我仍在进行中。
I'm still working on that one, too.

604
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:40,580
她想救别人的命,
She wanted save someone's life,

605
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,730
她在死的时候做到了这一点。
which she did that in death.

606
00:34:43,730 --> 00:34:48,170
她想拥有两处房产，其中一处养牲畜。
She wanted to own two pieces of property, one with livestock.

607
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:49,340
我犹豫了这项清单。
I hesitated on that one.

608
00:34:49,340 --> 00:34:51,310
我拥有两处房产,
I've owned two pieces of property,

609
00:34:51,310 --> 00:34:53,510
但并没有养牲畜。
but they didn't have livestock on them.

610
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:58,190
去阻止两个为她打架的男人。
She went to break up a fight between two guys over her.

611
00:34:58,190 --> 00:34:59,570
不，我还没做过那个。
No, I haven't done that one.

612
00:34:59,570 --> 00:35:02,000
穿过一片罂粟田。
She wanted to run through a poppy field.

613
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,700
我也没有实现这项清单。
I haven't done that, either.

614
00:35:03,700 --> 00:35:05,780
游览尼亚加拉大瀑布。
Tour Niagara Falls.

615
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:08,000
我想去尼亚加拉大瀑布。
I'd love to go to Niagara Falls.

616
00:35:08,000 --> 00:35:09,320
生孩子。
And have children.

617
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:10,160
我不这么认为。
I don't think so.

618
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:11,600
这是一个
At this point, that's one I'm not

619
00:35:11,600 --> 00:35:13,730
我完成不了的遗愿清单。
going to accomplish on her bucket list.

620
00:35:13,730 --> 00:35:17,660
前往史密森尼博物馆并沿 66 号公路行驶。
Go to the Smithsonian and drive along Route 66.

621
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:21,900
从加州一路开到田纳西州。
Drove it all the way from California to Tennessee.

622
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,540
完成这些对她来说非常重要，
And it was so important to her that these

623
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:28,130
以至于我们知道这是我们想做的事情。
get done that we knew it was something that we wanted to do.

624
00:35:28,130 --> 00:35:31,640
我也制定了目标，那就是尽可能多地去尝试和
I also made the goal to try and do as many

625
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:36,340
完成遗愿清单上未完成的项目。
of the undone items on the bucket list.

626
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,950
进行心脏移植手术，
Having a heart transplant, 

627
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:39,730
有些事情她做不到。
there's things that she can't do.

628
00:35:39,730 --> 00:35:44,090
她不能跳伞，
She can't go skydiving or parachuting,

629
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:46,850
所以我们会替她做。
so we'll do that for her.

630
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:53,810
我跳不了伞，因为我太害怕了，但会完成它的。
It won't be me because I'm too scared, but it'll get done.

631
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:58,840
清单上我们能做的一切，我们都会做。
Everything on that list that we can do, we'll do.

632
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,540
当你被打败的时候，
When are defeated,  

633
00:36:00,540 --> 00:36:07,550
你不能假装你在精神上是优越的。
you cannot pretend that you are spiritually superior.

634
00:36:07,550 --> 00:36:15,880
坐下来，哭泣，忍受，说，哦，我的上帝,
Sit down, and cry, and suffer, and say, oh my God,

635
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:19,050
你为什么抛弃我？
why did you forsake me?

636
00:36:19,050 --> 00:36:21,680
你可以哭。
You are allowed to cry.

637
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,090
你可以被打败。
You are allowed to be defeated.

638
00:36:24,090 --> 00:36:27,700
如何不否认我的痛苦，因为如果我们否认它,
How not to deny my pain, because if we deny it,

639
00:36:27,700 --> 00:36:29,640
它会变得更大。
it will get bigger.

640
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,650
如何不被淹没在其中呢？
And how not to drown in it.

641
00:36:31,650 --> 00:36:36,700
当我们痛苦的时候，我们被呼求让美进来。
We are asked to let in beauty while we're suffering.

645
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:49,930
我听到了。
I hear it.

646
00:36:49,930 --> 00:36:52,030
我记得她小时候，
I remember when she was little, 

647
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:54,130
他们会把我的头靠在她的胸前，
and they would lay my head on her chest, 

647
00:36:54,130 --> 00:36:59,190
我会听到她的心声。
and I would hear her heart.

648
00:36:59,190 --> 00:37:00,545
这就是我今天的感受。
That's how I felt today.

650
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:09,840
我想这就是我多次听到的心声。
I thought that's the heart I heard so many times.

652
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:18,052
很好。
Good.

653
00:37:18,052 --> 00:37:20,040
谢谢你。
Thank you.

654
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,034
别客气。
You're welcome.

656
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:31,450
我经历了失去女儿的痛苦
I went through the experience of losing my daughter

657
00:37:31,450 --> 00:37:35,050
因为医院存在渎职和疏忽,
because there was malpractice and negligence in the hospital,

658
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:40,110
我女儿变成了植物人，真的。
and my daughter became a vegetable, really.

659
00:37:40,110 --> 00:37:45,410
昏迷了一年直到她最终死去。
In a coma for a year until she finally was liberated and died.

660
00:37:45,410 --> 00:37:47,640
我可以在余生中承担对
And I could carry for the rest of my life

661
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,320
所发生的事情的愤怒和怨恨的负担。
the burden of the anger and resentment of what happened.

662
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:55,230
我可以指责并起诉医院。
I could blame and sue the hospital.

663
00:37:55,230 --> 00:37:57,450
但我选择了写书。
But I chose to write a book instead.

664
00:37:57,450 --> 00:38:01,620
在那本书里，我瞥见了整个过程。
And in that book I sort of glimpsed the whole thing.

665
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:03,390
我明白发生了什么事。
I understood what had happened.

666
00:38:03,390 --> 00:38:06,810
我意识到其中没有恶意。
I realized that there was no bad intention.

667
00:38:06,810 --> 00:38:10,340
有无知，有疏忽，
There was ignorance, negligence, 

668
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,110
但并没有伤害她的目的存于其中。
but not the purpose of harming her.

669
00:38:14,110 --> 00:38:17,960
我宽恕了这件事，我已经能够
And I forgave, and I've been able to live

670
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:22,610
带着我女儿快乐的精神生活了19年。
for 19 years with the spirit of my daughter happily.

671
00:38:22,610 --> 00:38:25,760
我不背负这个负担。
I don't carry that burden with me.

672
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,120
每当我难以宽恕时,
Whenever I'm having a difficult time forgiving,

673
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,320
我想到了伊利·巴吉萨。
I think of Immaculee Ilibagiza.

675
00:38:39,990 --> 00:38:41,500
我在家待了... 一天。
I was home for ... Day.

677
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:46,140
我兄弟来到我的房间
My brother come to my room--

678
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,430
你还在睡觉吗？
You're still sleeping?

679
00:38:47,430 --> 00:38:49,840
他看起来好像醒了好几个小时。
He looked like he was awake for many hours.

680
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:51,900
你不知道发生了什么吗？
You don't know what happened?

681
00:38:51,900 --> 00:38:54,420
我从床上跳下来，我从来没有
I jumped out of the bed, I never did this

682
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:57,439
在我哥哥面前这么做过，我穿上我的衣服。
before in front of my brother, put on my clothes.

683
00:38:57,439 --> 00:38:58,516
我们会赢的！
We will win!

684
00:38:58,516 --> 00:38:59,593
我们会赢的！
We will win!

685
00:38:59,593 --> 00:39:00,670
找蟑螂！（对恶语）
Find the cockroaches!

686
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,750
找蟑螂！
Find the cockroaches!

687
00:39:01,750 --> 00:39:02,830
他说,
He said,

688
00:39:02,830 --> 00:39:06,440
我们国家的总统昨晚去世了。
The president of our country died last night.

689
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:09,820
他们会杀了我们的。
They're going to kill us.

690
00:39:09,820 --> 00:39:11,570
我来自一个图西族部落。
I come from a tribe of Tutsi.

691
00:39:11,570 --> 00:39:13,580
我们部落很受欢迎。
It was well-loved.

692
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:16,490
我们有点怀疑会发生什么事。
And we kind of suspected something might happen.

693
00:39:16,490 --> 00:39:18,760
我父母让我躲在一个邻居家
My parents sent me to hide to a neighbor, 

694
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:21,185
他是胡图族人。
who was from the Hutu tribe.

695
00:39:21,185 --> 00:39:24,200
他是位新教牧师，
It was a protestant pastor, and he

696
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:26,240
他让我和其他七名妇女
put me to sleep in a bathroom of three

697
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:29,180
睡在三乘四英尺的浴室里。
by four feet with other seven women.

698
00:39:29,180 --> 00:39:33,610
我们不能谈话，不能说话，就像那个人告诉我们的那样,
We couldn't talk, we couldn't speak, as the man told us,

699
00:39:33,610 --> 00:39:36,570
我甚至不会告诉我的孩子们。
I won't even tell my children.

700
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,090
一个错误，一个错误。
One mistake, one mistake.

701
00:39:38,090 --> 00:39:39,756
不是我不信任我的孩子,
It's not that I don't trust my children,

702
00:39:39,756 --> 00:39:42,460
但这个错误，对你们来说已经太迟了，
but this mistake, it would be too late for you

703
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:46,188
你们的人生就完了。
and your life will be over.

704
00:39:46,188 --> 00:39:49,820
别用淋浴器。
Don't use the shower.

705
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:52,067
仅当有人在隔壁浴室
Only flush the water of the bathroom

706
00:39:52,067 --> 00:39:54,400
冲水时才冲水。
when someone is flushing the water in the next bathroom.


708
00:39:58,204 --> 00:39:59,787
我认为我们需要待上一周，
I think [? that we'll be in for ?] a

709
00:39:59,787 --> 00:40:01,540
也许更短的时间。
week or maybe less.

710
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:05,160
如果我们小心点，我们也许能挺过去。
But if we are careful, we might live through this.

711
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,580
大家小心点。
Just be careful.

713
00:40:09,660 --> 00:40:12,840
我们原只待两三天。
We thought it was going to be two, three days.

714
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:17,385
我们后来在那间浴室里待了三个月。
We spent in that bathroom three months.

715
00:40:17,385 --> 00:40:20,342
你不能放松警惕。
You must not let your guard down.

716
00:40:20,342 --> 00:40:22,050
图西族份子东躲西藏,
The Tutsi snakes are hiding in the grass,

717
00:40:22,050 --> 00:40:24,056
所以要确保你...
so make sure that you have your [INAUDIBLE] 

718
00:40:24,056 --> 00:40:26,110
把他们劈成两半。
ready to chop the snakes in half.

719
00:40:26,110 --> 00:40:27,410
我们不能洗澡。
We couldn't shower.

720
00:40:27,410 --> 00:40:31,730
我们每天都在等刽子手来找我们。
We were waiting for killers to find us every day.

721
00:40:31,730 --> 00:40:33,850
如果你在田间工作，
If you're working a field and 

722
00:40:33,850 --> 00:40:36,670
发现灌木丛中有在哺乳的图西族妇女,
spot a Tutsi woman in the bushes breastfeeding her baby,

723
00:40:36,670 --> 00:40:39,006
不要浪费这个千载难逢的机会。
don't waste a golden opportunity.

724
00:40:39,006 --> 00:40:42,340
拿起你的枪，射击他们，把他们劈成两半
Pick up your gun, shoot them, chop the snakes in half.

725
00:40:42,340 --> 00:40:44,300
别忘了杀了孩子。
Don't forget to kill the baby.

726
00:40:44,300 --> 00:40:47,280
斩草除根。
The child of a snake is a snake.

727
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:49,740
他们挨家挨户地搜查,
They went home by home to search,

728
00:40:49,740 --> 00:40:51,570
看看有没有人躲起来。
to see if anyone was hiding.

729
00:40:51,570 --> 00:40:54,900
这是一个由政府雇佣的组织，
And this was a group that was paid by the government, 

730
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:57,240
给他们提供食物、饮料和烟。
given food, and drink, smokes.

731
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:00,230
他们第一次来的时候，我记得我在看,
The first time they came, I remember I was watching,

732
00:41:00,230 --> 00:41:02,864
我透过浴室的小窗户看到了他们。
and I saw them through the tiny window of the bathroom.

734
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,582
男人们围着房子转，
The men circled the house 

735
00:41:09,582 --> 00:41:11,560
以免有人从窗户跳出来，
so that no one jumps out of the window

735
00:41:11,560 --> 00:41:12,690
然后他们开始喊叫。
and then they started to scream.

737
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:22,590
他们进了每个房间，钻到了床底下,
They went in every room, they went under the beds,

738
00:41:22,590 --> 00:41:24,175
他们甚至打开行李箱，
they even opened suitcases 

739
00:41:24,175 --> 00:41:26,775
以确保没有婴儿藏在里面。
to make sure there was no babies hiding.

741
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,373
他们打着手电筒进入房子的天花板，
They went in the ceiling of the house with flashlights 

742
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:36,214
确保没人躲在天花板里。
to make sure no one is hiding in the ceiling.

743
00:41:36,214 --> 00:41:37,630
他们还会去屋顶，
They went on the roof of the house

744
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,690
确保没人躲在那里。
to make sure no one is laying there.

745
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:45,170
我记得我问，如果你在那里，可以控制这一切,
I remember asking, if you are there, can control all this,

746
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:50,535
千万别让他们发现浴室的门。
please don't let them find the door of the bathroom.

747
00:41:50,535 --> 00:41:53,240
就像千根针刺进你的身体。
A thousand needles went through your body.

748
00:41:53,240 --> 00:41:54,500
很痛苦。
It was painful.

749
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:56,860
那不是一点点恐惧，而是很多很多。
It wasn't a little fear, it was a lot.

750
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:58,480
感觉人生就要结束了。
Your life was about to be over.

751
00:41:58,480 --> 00:42:00,310
你即将被砍刀砍死
You are about to be cut by machetes.

753
00:42:04,430 --> 00:42:05,555
图西族人呢？
Where are the Tutsis?

754
00:42:05,555 --> 00:42:07,680
不，不，不，我不知道你在说什么。
No, no, no, don't know what you're talking about.

755
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,640
我是个胡图族良民。
I'm a good Hutu.

756
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:10,910
我绝不会把图西族人藏起来，这里没有图西族人。
I would never hide Tutsis, there are no Tutsis here.

757
00:42:10,910 --> 00:42:14,845
我不想和政府有任何矛盾。
I don't want any problem with the government.

758
00:42:14,845 --> 00:42:16,994
你了解我的，我会保护这个家的。
You know me, I shall protect this house.

759
00:42:16,994 --> 00:42:18,910
那些图西族叛军进来攻击我
First those Tutsi rebels come in and attack me

760
00:42:18,910 --> 00:42:20,940
因为我是个好胡图族人。
for being such a good Hutu.

761
00:42:20,940 --> 00:42:23,269
他们直接来到浴室门口。
They came right to the door of the bathroom.

762
00:42:23,269 --> 00:42:24,560
其中一个碰了把手。
One of them touched the handle.

764
00:42:29,741 --> 00:42:31,520
他告诉那个人。
He told the man.

765
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,320
你知道吗？
You know what?

767
00:42:35,300 --> 00:42:38,060
我相信你。
I trust you.

768
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:39,532
你是个好人。
You are a good man.

769
00:42:39,532 --> 00:42:40,576
哦，谢谢。
Oh, thank you.

771
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:45,658
你现在是我们的一员了。
You are one of us now.

773
00:42:50,110 --> 00:42:51,852
我是说，当看到他时，我们跳了起来。
I mean, when we saw him, we jumped.

774
00:42:51,852 --> 00:42:53,560
我们以为是凶手在找我们。
We thought it was the killers finding us.

775
00:42:53,560 --> 00:42:54,900
你们现在安全了。
You're safe now.

776
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:56,540
你们能活下来已经很幸运了。
You're lucky to be alive.

777
00:42:56,540 --> 00:43:01,160
头五个小时我们完全麻木了。
We were completely numb for the first five hours.

778
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:02,980
我不知道你们是怎么祈祷的,
I don't know how you are praying,

779
00:43:02,980 --> 00:43:04,150
也不知道你们是否在祈祷。
or if you're even praying.

780
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:07,182
但不管你们在做什么，请坚持下去。
But whatever you're doing, please keep doing it.

782
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,010
我在浴室里的感觉
You know, the feelings I had in that bathroom

783
00:43:15,010 --> 00:43:19,610
是我一生中从未经历过的事情。
were things I never experienced in my life.

784
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:22,970
我很生气，无法用言语表达。
I had anger, anger I cannot put in words.

785
00:43:22,970 --> 00:43:26,180
我的意思是，有时候人们讨厌一个人,
I mean, sometimes people hate one person,

786
00:43:26,180 --> 00:43:27,560
就已经够糟了。
and that's bad enough.

787
00:43:27,560 --> 00:43:29,990
而我讨厌八百万人。
I hated like eight million people.

788
00:43:29,990 --> 00:43:32,590
我记得我当时想，当我出来的时候,
And I remember thinking, when I got out,

789
00:43:32,590 --> 00:43:34,070
我要成为一名战士，
I'm going to be a soldier, 

790
00:43:34,070 --> 00:43:36,540
我会训练身体和肌肉，
and I will train my body and muscles, 

790
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:38,050
然后杀了所有胡图族人。
and just kill everybody.

791
00:43:38,050 --> 00:43:41,480
在愤怒时，我就是兰博（电影第一滴血主角，由史泰龙扮演）。
In my anger, I was Rambo.

792
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:45,740
在我看过的一些电影里，我感觉自己在杀人。
In some movies I have seen, I was killing people.

793
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,030
带着这些想法，我会出于愤怒而发誓。
With these thoughts I would be swearing out of anger.

794
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:52,880
我坐在浴室里带着这些想法,
And I'm sitting in the bathroom with these thoughts,

795
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:57,680
我的头很痛，我的胃也很痛。
my head would be aching, and my stomach is aching.

796
00:43:57,680 --> 00:44:00,840
为什么我的念头会激起这种毒素？
Why my thoughts are provoking this poison?

797
00:44:00,840 --> 00:44:03,810
我只是在想我想做的事。
I'm only thinking of things I want to do.

798
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:05,820
我的想法是怎么回事？
What is going on with my thoughts here?

800
00:44:08,500 --> 00:44:12,520
当我们害怕的时候，很难记住爱。
It's very hard to remember love when we are scared.

801
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:14,620
恐惧是世界上
Being afraid is one of the strongest

802
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:17,080
最强大的的情感之一。
emotions in the world.

803
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:19,880
我们的心率随着每次心跳而变化。
Our heart rate varies with each and every heartbeat.

804
00:44:19,880 --> 00:44:23,710
当我们沮丧、焦虑和情绪低落时,
And when we're frustrated and anxious and emotionally upset,

805
00:44:23,710 --> 00:44:26,840
心脏的节奏变得非常不连贯和参差不齐。
the rhythm of the heart becomes very incoherent and jagged.

806
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:29,840
这基本上会在人体系统中产生一种噪音，
And this basically creates a noise in the system 

807
00:44:29,840 --> 00:44:32,300
淹没了直觉信号。
that drowns out the intuitive signals.

808
00:44:32,300 --> 00:44:36,910
我记得当时在想，这房子有两个浴室。
I remember thinking, this home has two bathrooms.

809
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,980
如果他们没有这两个浴室,
If they didn't have these two bathrooms,

810
00:44:38,980 --> 00:44:41,520
我们怎么可能藏在里面？
how could we have been hidden here?

811
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:42,910
他们会找到我们的。
They would have find us.

812
00:44:42,910 --> 00:44:46,360
只有房子里有两个浴室,
It was only home that had two bathrooms inside the house,

813
00:44:46,360 --> 00:44:49,780
这让我感觉很好。
and that made me feel good.

814
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,300
当我想到好的方面时，
When I was thinking the good, 

814
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,470
它是如此与众不同，
it was so distinctive

815
00:44:53,470 --> 00:44:55,810
因为你的感情是如此之嗨，
because the feelings were so high 

816
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,200
以至于你能感觉到不同，
you can feel the difference 

817
00:44:57,200 --> 00:45:01,180
就像有人推着你并把你举起来。
like someone just pushed you down and lifted you up.

818
00:45:01,180 --> 00:45:03,400
好像很清明似的。
Like it's so clearly.

819
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:06,355
然后我开始想，我们可以吃东西了。
And I started thinking, we can eat.

820
00:45:06,355 --> 00:45:08,240
感谢上帝，这个人有孩子。
Thank God this man has children.

821
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,590
我们可以吃剩菜，即使不是很多。
We can eat the leftovers, even if it was not much.

822
00:45:11,590 --> 00:45:13,540
所以我开始去看好的一面，
So I started to see the good, 

823
00:45:13,540 --> 00:45:16,430
好像我的心是敞开的。
and it was like my heart was open.

824
00:45:16,430 --> 00:45:19,650
看着这些人，我能触碰到他们。
Look at these people, I can touch somebody.

825
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:22,390
只是为了看到一切的美好。
Just to see the good in everything.

826
00:45:22,390 --> 00:45:25,710
欣赏是一种与心灵相关的感觉。
Appreciation is a heart related feeling.

827
00:45:25,710 --> 00:45:27,640
它需要使用心灵的智慧
It requires access to the intelligence

828
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:31,250
去欣赏或感恩。
of the heart to appreciate, or to have gratitude.

829
00:45:31,250 --> 00:45:35,670
当我这么想的时候，我觉得自己明智多了。
And when I was thinking that way, I felt much smarter.

830
00:45:35,670 --> 00:45:37,590
当我们处于一致状态时,
When we're in a coherent state,

831
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,090
从心脏到大脑的信号要强烈得多。
the signal from the heart to the brain is so much stronger.

832
00:45:40,090 --> 00:45:43,320
到达我们的额叶皮层时就更清晰了。
It gets up to our frontal cortex much clearer.

833
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:45,310
那是心在敲你的门,
That's the heart knocking on your door,

834
00:45:45,310 --> 00:45:47,590
说，打开门，我就在这里。
saying, open the door, here I am.

835
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:49,750
你需要我。
You need me.

836
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:52,310
因为你会说，哦，我在哪里？
Because then you say, ooh, where am I?

837
00:45:52,310 --> 00:45:55,016
我在地狱。
I'm in hell.

838
00:45:55,016 --> 00:45:57,620
我不知道。
I didn't know that.

839
00:45:57,620 --> 00:46:01,525
但是心告诉你，相信我。
But the heart tells you, trust me.

840
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:03,420
当你出来的时候...
And when you're out of that...

841
00:46:03,420 --> 00:46:06,430
它开始非常非常迅速地转移能量，
It begins to shift the energies very, very quickly

842
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:09,560
这样你就进入了超越问题的
so that you come into another level of buoyancy that

843
00:46:09,560 --> 00:46:11,530
另一个层次的空间。
rises above the problem.

844
00:46:11,530 --> 00:46:14,030
这样一来，你就可以看透它。
And in doing so, you can then see into it.

845
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:18,580
然后你就可以找到解决问题的方法。
You can then find ways to deal with it.

846
00:46:18,580 --> 00:46:21,010
他们回来了。
They're coming back.

847
00:46:21,010 --> 00:46:23,410
我心里很清楚。
It was so clear in my heart.

848
00:46:23,410 --> 00:46:25,791
这次他们想找到你。
This time they want to find you.

849
00:46:25,791 --> 00:46:28,146
牧师。
Pastor.

850
00:46:28,146 --> 00:46:30,480
把衣柜推到门前。
Push the wardrobe in front of the door.

851
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:32,443
他们不会发现有门的。
They're not going to see there is a door.

852
00:46:32,443 --> 00:46:33,832
不，不，为什么？
No, no, why?

853
00:46:33,832 --> 00:46:36,123
如果他们来了，就会发现不在这里。
If they come, they'll realize it wasn't here.

854
00:46:36,123 --> 00:46:37,485
求你了。
I'm begging you.

856
00:46:42,930 --> 00:46:44,415
好的。
OK.

857
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:48,880
好吧，好吧，我会把柜子推过去。
OK, OK, I will put it.

858
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,710
很明显我需要倾听这个直觉。
And it was so clear that I need to listen to that.

860
00:47:05,710 --> 00:47:06,795
他们来搜查了。
They came to search.

862
00:47:14,325 --> 00:47:15,774
她在哪，牧师？
Where is she, Pastor?

863
00:47:15,774 --> 00:47:17,926
这是她最后出现的地方。
This is the last place she was seen.

864
00:47:17,926 --> 00:47:19,372
我们知道她在这里。
We know she's here.

866
00:47:22,264 --> 00:47:23,228
伊玛库莱！
Immaculée!

868
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:32,790
其中一个说，我杀了399只蟑螂。
One of them said, I've killed 399 cockroaches.

868
00:47:26,130 --> 00:47:32,790
{\an8}一些胡图族民族主义者称呼图西族人为蟑螂

869
00:47:32,790 --> 00:47:36,876
他说，我希望伊玛库莱是第400个。
And he said, I want Immaculee to be the 400th.

870
00:47:36,876 --> 00:47:38,920
我在想，这个人，我认识他。
And I'm thinking, this man, I knew him.

871
00:47:38,920 --> 00:47:41,920
他是我的小学同学。
He was a school mate in elementary school.

872
00:47:41,920 --> 00:47:43,910
一个我可以称之为朋友的人。
Someone I can call a friend.

873
00:47:43,910 --> 00:47:48,916
怎么会有人说他用弯刀杀了399个图西人,
How can somebody say he killed 399 people by machete,

874
00:47:48,916 --> 00:47:51,380
而且他还很骄傲呢？！
but he was proud?

875
00:47:51,380 --> 00:47:53,516
他们打开了衣柜。
They went right in the wardrobe.

877
00:48:00,656 --> 00:48:04,970
如果没有那个衣柜，他们本可以找到我们的。
They could have find us if that wardrobe was not there.

878
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:08,120
后来他说，好主意。
And later he said, good idea.

879
00:48:08,120 --> 00:48:10,200
我甚至都不想邀功,
It wasn't even like I wanted to take credit, 

880
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:12,110
比如说，哦，太好了，我有个好主意。
like oh good, I had a good idea.

881
00:48:12,110 --> 00:48:15,380
就好像，继续倾听心声。
It was just like, keep listening.

882
00:48:15,380 --> 00:48:21,060
知道如何分辨那不被仇恨、羡慕、嫉妒和
Know how to distinguish that clarity that is not covered 

883
00:48:21,060 --> 00:48:25,500
任何不爱的东西所覆盖的那份清明。
by hate, by envy, by jealousy, by anything unloving.

884
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,350
这就是它真正的出现方式。
That is really how it comes out.

885
00:48:27,350 --> 00:48:30,500
这是一个事实，
It comes as a truth that you know

886
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:36,650
不是被不好的东西驱使的。
is not motivated by something not nice.

887
00:48:36,650 --> 00:48:38,880
有趣的是，他们离开时,
And the funny part, when they left,

888
00:48:38,880 --> 00:48:40,760
我的愤怒又回来了。
the anger came right back.

889
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,190
就像沉入水底的石油
It was just like a ... oil coming back

890
00:48:43,190 --> 00:48:47,510
又浮出水面，就像我拉开了面前的面纱。
on the top of the water, like a veil I pulled in front.

891
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:49,400
我无法说话，无法思考。
I couldn't say, I couldn't think.

892
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:53,180
哦，我的身体又开始疼了，头也痛了。。
Oh, my body's aching again, and my headache.

893
00:48:53,180 --> 00:48:56,660
当有人在杀你的同胞时，你就会这么做的。
But that's what you do when people are killing your people.

894
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:57,950
你会生气。
You get angry.

895
00:48:57,950 --> 00:48:59,790
我甚至没有想到
So I didn't even think 

895
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:04,090
还有别的办法来处理这个问题
there was another way to deal with this.

896
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:08,450
尽管我为自己的身体付出了代价,
Despite the price I was paying with my own body,

897
00:49:08,450 --> 00:49:11,330
我不记得怎样因愤怒而微笑。
I couldn't remember how to smile cause of anger.

898
00:49:11,330 --> 00:49:13,880
我觉得我的嘴巴扭曲了。
I felt like my mouth was twisted.

899
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:16,280
我希望再次成为无辜之人。
I wished to be innocent again.

900
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,360
我希望看到人们善良的一面。
I wished to see good in people.

901
00:49:18,360 --> 00:49:20,660
但对我来说，他们是动物。
But for me, they were animals.

902
00:49:20,660 --> 00:49:22,190
他们很坏。
They were bad.

903
00:49:22,190 --> 00:49:25,460
他们是些邪恶的人。
They were just evil people.

904
00:49:25,460 --> 00:49:29,850
每天我都要祷告200次我们的主祷文。
Every day I prayed about 200 our Lord's Prayer.


906
00:49:33,950 --> 00:49:37,076
每次我读到这句话的时候，即：
Any time I reached the part that said, 

906
00:49:37,076 --> 00:49:40,760
“宽恕我们的罪过，
forgive us our trespasses

907
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,219
正如我们宽恕那些侵犯我们的人一样“，
as we forgive those who trespass against us, 

907
00:49:44,219 --> 00:49:46,339
我说不出这句话。
I couldn't say it.

908
00:49:46,339 --> 00:49:49,032
请赐给我们今天的食物。
Give us this day our daily bread.

909
00:49:49,032 --> 00:49:49,832
我宽恕...
Forgive...

911
00:49:53,830 --> 00:49:55,760
每次我经历这种情况，
Any time I went through that part 

911
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,560
就像遇到危险信号。
it was like a red flag.

912
00:49:57,560 --> 00:49:59,790
然后我说，我该怎么办？
And then I said, how can I deal with it?

913
00:49:59,790 --> 00:50:05,660
因为我无法宽恕，因为这是不可宽恕的事。
Because I can't forgive, because this is unforgivable thing.

914
00:50:05,660 --> 00:50:06,920
他们想杀了我。
They tried to kill me.

915
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,720
你怎么能宽恕这种事？
How do you forgive such a thing?

916
00:50:08,720 --> 00:50:12,590
我希望我可以，但是在这种情况下，行不通啊！
I wished I could, but it didn't make sense in my situation.

917
00:50:12,590 --> 00:50:16,130
有一次我说，等等，我有个更好的主意。
So one time I said, wait a minute, I have a better idea.

918
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:19,350
我想，让我跳过这部分的祈祷。
I thought, let me skip that part of the prayer.

919
00:50:19,350 --> 00:50:22,550
那我就不用说了，这样剩下的，我就可以说了。
So then I don't have to say it, then I can say the rest.

920
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:27,140
我内心认为，上帝知晓一切，祂知道我没有说谎。
So then within me, God is OK, now he knows I'm not lying.

921
00:50:27,140 --> 00:50:29,300
谎言是不会长久的。
Lies don't sit well in the body.

922
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:34,620
我开始跳过这部分祷文，我感觉好多了。
And I start to skip it, and I felt so much better.

923
00:50:34,620 --> 00:50:37,220
我修改了祷文，之后我听到有个声音，说，
So I edited it, and now this voice says--

924
00:50:37,220 --> 00:50:39,770
你在修改祂的祷告。
You are editing His prayer.

925
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:43,920
如果我是你，我不会试图修改祂的祷告。
If I were you, I wouldn't try to edit his prayer.

926
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:45,740
我今天可以这么说笑，
You know, I can say this laughing today,

927
00:50:45,740 --> 00:50:48,960
但那时我的心情很糟糕。
but that time my mood was crushed.

928
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:52,010
我记得这就像是放弃，
I remember it was like giving up, 

928
00:50:52,010 --> 00:50:55,010
或者我可以称之为臣服？
or can I call it surrender?

929
00:50:55,010 --> 00:51:00,260
我跪下来，举起双手，祈求上帝。
I went to my knees, and I put my hands up, and I begged God.

930
00:51:00,260 --> 00:51:02,120
我要把那句话放回祈祷文中。
I'm going to put it back in prayer.

931
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:04,260
因为如果你这样祈祷，
Because if you said pray this way, 

932
00:51:04,260 --> 00:51:06,860
你一定知道这样做是对的。
you must know it is the right thing to do.

933
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:08,600
我把它交到你手里。
I'm putting it in your hands.

934
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:10,910
如果你知道如何宽恕，那就帮帮我。
If you know how to forgive, help me out.

935
00:51:10,910 --> 00:51:12,260
我很愿意。
I am willing.

936
00:51:12,260 --> 00:51:13,300
那真是个一个很大的转变。
That was a big shift.

938
00:51:32,370 --> 00:51:34,344
我记得他们来到了一个点，
I remember they came to a point 

939
00:51:34,344 --> 00:51:37,874
就像世界被分成了两部分。
when it was like the world was divided in two parts.

940
00:51:37,874 --> 00:51:41,260
一部分是爱，一部分是恨。
A part of love, and a part of hate.

941
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:44,250
在爱的部分是像曼德拉、
In the part of love are people like Mandela,

942
00:51:44,250 --> 00:51:46,940
特蕾莎修女和甘地这样的人。
like Mother Teresa, Gandhi.

943
00:51:46,940 --> 00:51:47,930
他们是自愿受苦的人。
People who suffered.

944
00:51:47,930 --> 00:51:50,200
不管他们遭受了多少痛苦,
And no matter how much they suffered,

945
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,570
他们仍然坚持真理。
they still stand up for truth.

946
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:54,250
他们仍然为爱而战，
They still stand up for love, 

947
00:51:54,250 --> 00:51:57,640
为捍卫另一个人的权利而站出来。
for defense of another human being's rights.

948
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,630
在仇恨的一面，
And then on the side of hate, 

948
00:51:59,630 --> 00:52:01,210
我看到像希特勒这样的人,
I see people like Hitler,

949
00:52:01,210 --> 00:52:03,940
那些在卢旺达制造种族灭绝的人，
like those who were causing genocide in Rwanda 

950
00:52:03,940 --> 00:52:08,020
他们报复心很强，易怒，就像当时的我一样。
who are vengeful, angry, like me at that time.

951
00:52:08,020 --> 00:52:10,030
我感觉上帝在问我，
And I felt like God was asking me, 

951
00:52:10,030 --> 00:52:11,830
你想站在哪一边？
where do you want to stand?

952
00:52:11,830 --> 00:52:13,364
你想属于哪里？
Where do you want to belong?

954
00:52:17,346 --> 00:52:21,205
你想属于爱的一边还是恨的一边？
Do you want to belong to side of love or the side of hate?

955
00:52:21,205 --> 00:52:22,450
你猜怎么着？
And guess what?

956
00:52:22,450 --> 00:52:24,310
属于爱的一方的人，
People who belong on the side of love,

957
00:52:24,310 --> 00:52:26,930
他们知道不公正，
they have known injustice,

958
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:28,970
他们知道仇恨，
they have known hate,

959
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,180
他们知道人们是被恶劣对待的。
they have known how to be treated bad.

960
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,286
但这是你的选择。
But it's your choice.

962
00:52:36,892 --> 00:52:40,430
我记得很清楚，我说,
And I remember, it was so clear that I said,

963
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:43,000
我当然想和甘地和曼德拉在一起。
of course I want to be with Gandhi, with Mandela.

964
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,560
我钦佩这些人。
I admire these people.

965
00:52:44,560 --> 00:52:46,690
我崇拜特蕾莎修女。
I admired Mother Teresa.

966
00:52:46,690 --> 00:52:47,930
我想成为他们那样的人。
I want to be like them.

967
00:52:47,930 --> 00:52:49,090
那他们做了什么呢？
So what did they do?

968
00:52:49,090 --> 00:52:51,490
他们相信人是可以改变的。
They believed people can change.

969
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:57,010
这是我内在思维的一个巨大转变。
That was a huge shift in my thinking in my body.

970
00:52:57,010 --> 00:52:58,840
人确实会变的。
People do change.

971
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,820
我记得当时在想，等一下。
And I remember thinking, wait a minute.

972
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:03,220
我不认为人真的可以改变。
I don't think people can really change.

973
00:53:03,220 --> 00:53:05,500
再等一下。
Now, wait a minute again.

974
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:07,980
看看我，我正改变所有这些想法。
Look at me, I'm changing with all these thoughts.

976
00:53:11,380 --> 00:53:15,140
当我意识到人是会变的,
So when I realized that people actually do change,

977
00:53:15,140 --> 00:53:19,390
人们有能力以不同的方式看待事物时,
people have the capacity to see things differently,

978
00:53:19,390 --> 00:53:22,450
那时我才意识到我是可以放手的。
that's when I realized I can let it go.

979
00:53:22,450 --> 00:53:27,100
我感觉从洗手间到了一个有清新之地。
I felt like I moved from the bathroom to a place of air.

980
00:53:27,100 --> 00:53:30,440
这就是爱在我身体里的感觉。
That's how love felt in my body.

981
00:53:30,440 --> 00:53:32,000
我闻不到任何不好的味道。
I couldn't smell nothing bad.

982
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:34,000
就好像我在漂浮。
It was like I was floating.

984
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:40,872
而那是我心中的天堂。
And that was a paradise in my heart.

985
00:53:40,872 --> 00:53:43,000
我想到了那些杀人犯，
I thought about the killers, 

986
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,740
我应该对他们有慈心。
I should have compassion towards them.

987
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:51,581
想象一下，那个杀了100个人的人，
Imagine the person who killed 100 people, 

988
00:53:51,581 --> 00:53:55,370
他从孩子们身边夺走了他们的父母。
who have took away fathers and mothers from their kids.

989
00:53:55,370 --> 00:53:59,420
当他们有一天醒来，意识到自己在做什么时，
What are they going to become when they wake up one day

990
00:53:59,420 --> 00:54:01,180
他们会变成什么呢？
and they realize what they're doing?

991
00:54:01,180 --> 00:54:02,750
一个向他们乞求生活的人吗？
Someone who begged them for life?

993
00:54:14,490 --> 00:54:17,850
当我们出来的时候，就像世界末日一样。
When we came out, it was like end of the world.

994
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:20,444
有一百多万人被杀了。
A million people and more was killed.

995
00:54:20,444 --> 00:54:26,930
我妈妈、爸爸、两个兄弟、奶奶
My mom, my father, my two brothers, my grandma

996
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:29,750
爷爷、邻居们以及
and my grandpa, neighbors,

997
00:54:29,750 --> 00:54:32,690
我的同学还有最好的朋友都被杀了。
my schoolmates, my best friends.

998
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:34,920
那是世界末日。
It was the end of the world.

999
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,240
到处都是人们的尸体。
Everywhere was their bodies.

1000
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:39,800
但是我的心已经变了。
But something have changed in my heart.

1001
00:54:39,800 --> 00:54:41,330
我内心很坚强。
I was strong inside.

1002
00:54:41,330 --> 00:54:45,200
我真的准备好以不同的方式面对生活了。
I was really ready to face life in a different way.

1003
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:46,820
我骨瘦如柴。
I'm a skeleton.

1004
00:54:46,820 --> 00:54:48,580
只有65磅。
I'm 65 pounds.

1005
00:54:48,580 --> 00:54:53,030
但在内心深处，我感觉自己很高大，感觉自己更美丽。
But inside, I felt huge, I felt more beautiful.

1006
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,670
我觉得每个人都是上帝的恩赐,
I felt like everybody was just a gift of God,

1007
00:54:55,670 --> 00:54:59,840
我只想服务他人，帮助他人，关心他人。
and I just wanted to serve, to help, and to care.

1008
00:54:59,840 --> 00:55:02,480
我第一次对我认为永远
For the first time I'm being grateful

1009
00:55:02,480 --> 00:55:06,080
理所当然的事情心存感激。
for things I took for granted forever.

1010
00:55:06,080 --> 00:55:09,560
我可以跟别人打招呼，而不会被人杀死。
And I can say hi to somebody without anyone killing me.

1011
00:55:09,560 --> 00:55:13,300
我记得在傍晚时分，暖风拂面。
And then I remember in evening, this nice wind.

1012
00:55:13,300 --> 00:55:17,180
树木摇曳，我能感觉风在我的身体里。
The trees are moving, I can feel the wind in my body.

1013
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:19,580
我已经三个月没有这种感觉了。
I didn't feel this for three months.

1014
00:55:19,580 --> 00:55:22,470
我可以看见星星，可以看见月亮,
I can see the stars, I can see the moon,

1015
00:55:22,470 --> 00:55:23,853
而且我不用为此付任何代价。
and I don't have to pay for this.

1016
00:55:23,853 --> 00:55:26,620
我有没有过看着月亮，说,
Did I ever looked at the moon and said,

1017
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:28,310
"哇，有月亮真好？"
wow, nice to have the moon?

1018
00:55:28,310 --> 00:55:29,540
没有。
No.

1019
00:55:29,540 --> 00:55:33,380
那是一种无法抗拒的爱和感激的感觉。
It was overwhelming feeling of love and appreciation.

1020
00:55:33,380 --> 00:55:36,380
我想向全世界大叫。
I wanted to scream to the whole world.

1021
00:55:36,380 --> 00:55:39,775
你看到它的美了吗？
Do you see the beauty?

1022
00:55:39,775 --> 00:55:47,810
头脑可以理解概念上的整体性,
The mind can understand conceptually wholeness,

1023
00:55:47,810 --> 00:55:50,490
但是只有坚强的人才能体验到整体性。
but only the hard can experience wholeness.

1025
00:55:53,780 --> 00:55:56,980
如果我们能容纳我们所经历的,
And the reward, if we can endure what we experience,

1026
00:55:56,980 --> 00:56:01,620
其回报是我们不只抓住了整体性，还感受到了它。
is that we don't just grasp oneness, we feel it.

1028
00:56:04,790 --> 00:56:10,780
你的大脑把事情看成非黑即白，
Your head sees things as black or white, 

1029
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:19,290
是非善恶分明，
wrong or right, bad or good.

1030
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:24,310
头脑总是在曲直判断，总是失去平衡。
Head is always touching, always off balance.

1032
00:56:30,710 --> 00:56:33,530
我要等多久才能恢复清白？
How long do I have to wait for it to be white again?

1034
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:45,020
你看不到并不代表它不存在。
Just because you can't see it doesn't mean it isn't there.

1036
00:56:51,360 --> 00:56:56,625
心灵比头脑更快，也更明智。
The heart is much faster and wiser than the head.

1037
00:56:56,625 --> 00:56:58,420
在心灵的眼睛里，
In the eyes of the heart, 

1037
00:56:58,425 --> 00:57:01,360
黑白判断消失了，
black and white judgments disappear 

1038
00:57:01,360 --> 00:57:06,410
因为心被一个更深的真理所平衡。
because the heart is balanced by a deeper truth.

1039
00:57:06,410 --> 00:57:12,370
伟大的灵性把只有用心才能体会到的
The great spirit spins together moments of profound beauty

1040
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:16,410
深刻的美感的时刻编织在一起。
that can only be experienced with the heart.

1042
00:57:22,170 --> 00:57:25,760
我永远感激那间浴室。
I am forever grateful for that bathroom.

1043
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:29,960
不是去看邪恶把人带到哪里,
To see where evil can take people,

1044
00:57:29,960 --> 00:57:33,460
而是去看爱能把人领向何方。
but to see also where love can take people.

1045
00:57:33,460 --> 00:57:37,030
要认识到人们的弱点,
Just realize the weakness of people,

1046
00:57:37,030 --> 00:57:40,550
但也认出我们每个人内心的力量。
but the strength that is within each one of us.

1047
00:57:40,550 --> 00:57:44,240
心让我拓展，挖掘我的内心,
To push me that far, to dig within my heart,

1048
00:57:44,240 --> 00:57:46,786
相信自己内心的直觉。
and to trust that instinct within.

1050
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:53,230
当你能对这一切表示感谢，
And when you can give thanks for it all

1051
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:59,360
无条件地去爱，那么你就自由了。
and love without conditions, then you will be free.

1052
00:57:59,360 --> 00:58:01,529
这就是心的力量。
That is the power of the heart.

1054
00:58:06,020 --> 00:58:09,170
生活中充满了挑战。
Life is full of challenges.

1055
00:58:09,170 --> 00:58:12,260
挑战和困难往往是
Challenges and hardships often times

1056
00:58:12,260 --> 00:58:16,040
强烈的热焰，
are the intense heat and fire that

1057
00:58:16,040 --> 00:58:20,000
让我们敞开心扉去发现以前我们
break us open to discover gifts, talents and capacities 

1058
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,870
从未发现的本自具足的天赋、才能和能力。
within us that we would have never discovered before.

1060
00:58:23,870 --> 00:58:26,570
就像可以燃烧的火柴一样，
So like a match that holds fire,

1061
00:58:26,570 --> 00:58:29,420
但直到它撞擦到什么东西前，是不会产生火焰的。
but until it strikes against something you have no flame.

1063
00:58:32,270 --> 00:58:34,730
通过与经验的摩擦，
By rubbing up against experience,

1064
00:58:34,730 --> 00:58:37,808
我们的心就会燃烧起来，
our heart comes aflame, 

1064
00:58:37,808 --> 00:58:40,569
光和温暖就会从我们身上产生。
and light and warmth come from us.

1065
00:58:40,569 --> 00:58:42,110
你甚至可以对你想象中
You can even be grateful for things

1066
00:58:42,110 --> 00:58:45,570
对你没有任何好处的事情心存感激。
that you imagine that aren't any good for you.

1067
00:58:45,570 --> 00:58:47,480
那些你认为你并不真的想要的东西，
That you imagine that you don't really want, 

1068
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:50,270
或者你希望你不需要经历的事情。
or that you wish you hadn't had to experience.

1069
00:58:50,270 --> 00:58:54,980
即使在这样的时刻，大师们也会对生命说声谢谢,
Even in those moments, masters say thank you to life,

1070
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,979
对上帝说声谢谢，对神圣的自我说声谢谢，
thank you to God, thank you to the divine self

1071
00:58:57,979 --> 00:58:59,270
因为他有了这次特殊的经历。
for this particular experience.

1072
00:58:59,270 --> 00:59:01,334
因为我知道，过不了多久，
Because I know that before too long 

1073
00:59:01,334 --> 00:59:03,920
我将会看到已经融入到
I will see the extraordinary gift that

1074
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:09,410
这场物质身接触中的非凡礼物。
has been folded into this physical encounter.

1075
00:59:09,410 --> 00:59:11,370
种族屠杀六个月后，
Six months after the genocide, 

1075
00:59:11,370 --> 00:59:13,880
人们常常告诉我,
and people used to tell me,

1076
00:59:13,880 --> 00:59:16,140
你不能这么快就宽恕。
you can't forgive this quick.

1077
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:21,220
高兴得也太早了。
It's too quick to be happy.

1078
00:59:21,220 --> 00:59:23,330
发生了这种事，你怎么还笑得出来。
You can't be smiling after what happened.

1080
00:59:26,132 --> 00:59:28,750
有时这真的让我
And that really kind of made me 

1081
00:59:28,750 --> 00:59:30,890
不禁有点自我怀疑。
question a little bit sometimes.

1082
00:59:30,890 --> 00:59:31,940
我说，
I said, 

1082
00:59:31,940 --> 00:59:38,990
我是不是出于生存机制而快乐和宽恕？
am I happy and forgiving out of surviving mechanism?

1083
00:59:38,990 --> 00:59:40,350
我是不是有一天会被压垮？
Am I going to crush one day?

1084
00:59:40,350 --> 00:59:43,650
很多人告诉我，有一天，如果你看到他们,
Which many people told me, on one day, if you see them,

1085
00:59:43,650 --> 00:59:45,300
你会回到愤怒的状态。
you will go back to the anger.

1086
00:59:45,300 --> 00:59:46,500
我说，真的吗？
I said, really?

1087
00:59:46,500 --> 00:59:47,430
等着瞧吧。
Let me see.

1088
00:59:47,430 --> 00:59:51,090
我去监狱看那个
So I went to prison to see the person 

1088
00:59:51,090 --> 00:59:53,140
杀了我妈妈和我弟弟的人，
who have killed my mom and my brother, 

1089
00:59:53,140 --> 00:59:55,470
我本来是不会去见他的。
whom I would not have gone to meet him.

1090
00:59:55,470 --> 00:59:57,540
这对我没有一点好处。
It didn't serve me one bit.

1091
00:59:57,540 --> 01:00:00,960
我去那里只是想看看我的感受。
So I went there just to really see how I feel.

1092
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:03,322
我了解到监狱长
And I have learned the head of the jail

1093
01:00:03,322 --> 01:00:05,600
是我父亲的朋友，
is a friend of my father 

1094
01:00:05,600 --> 01:00:08,310
他失去了妻子和五个孩子。
who lost his wife and like five children.

1095
01:00:08,310 --> 01:00:11,750
我知道他会为我开门。
So I knew he would open the door for me.

1096
01:00:11,750 --> 01:00:12,910
你可以打他，
You can hit him, 

1096
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:15,730
可以做你想做的任何事，
you can do whatever you want,

1097
01:00:15,730 --> 01:00:20,440
因为我就在这里，
because I'm here now,

1098
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:21,370
我会保护你的。
I will protect you.

1100
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:25,710
这样可以减轻你的痛苦。
So ease up your pain.

1102
01:00:44,368 --> 01:00:45,860
他把那个人带来了。
And he brought the man.

1104
01:00:50,670 --> 01:00:51,510
我记得他。
I remember him.

1105
01:00:51,510 --> 01:00:53,950
他以前是个老师。
He used to be a teacher.

1106
01:00:53,950 --> 01:00:56,020
他就像我的父亲。
He was like a father to me.

1107
01:00:56,020 --> 01:00:57,520
他有和我一样大的孩子。
He had kids my age.

1108
01:00:57,520 --> 01:00:58,690
我以前常去看他们，
I used to visit them, 

1108
01:00:58,690 --> 01:01:02,090
和他们家人一起吃午饭。
and have lunch with the family.

1109
01:01:02,090 --> 01:01:05,240
是他干的吗！？
Now that's him who did that?

1110
01:01:05,240 --> 01:01:06,980
我崩溃了，哭了。
I just broke down and cried.

1112
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:12,380
我真的是出于对他和
And I truly cried out of compassion

1113
01:01:12,380 --> 01:01:14,030
他的家人的怜悯而哭泣。
towards him and his family.

1115
01:01:42,365 --> 01:01:43,850
我宽恕你。
I forgive you.

1117
01:01:50,780 --> 01:01:52,265
我宽恕你。
I forgive you.

1119
01:01:56,750 --> 01:02:00,060
这并不是说，哦，我计划过要说这些话。
It wasn't like, oh, I planned to say these words.

1120
01:02:00,060 --> 01:02:01,950
有些事我想表达一下,
There's something I wanted to express,

1121
01:02:01,950 --> 01:02:05,060
不过我无法用言语来表达。
and I couldn't find words to say it fully.

1122
01:02:05,060 --> 01:02:07,670
我希望他能从我这里得自由。
I wanted him to be free from me.

1123
01:02:07,670 --> 01:02:10,200
而不是去想，哦，她在生我的气。
Not to think, oh, she's mad at me.

1124
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:11,804
你知道，我不能什么都不做。
You know, I can't do nothing.

1125
01:02:11,804 --> 01:02:13,220
我只是想给他一个机会
I just wanted him to have a chance

1126
01:02:13,220 --> 01:02:16,230
从他自己的心去经历他自己的旅程,
to go through his own journey from his own heart,

1127
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,530
而不是因为有人生他的气,
not because somebody is angry at him,

1128
01:02:18,530 --> 01:02:20,085
或者有人把他关进了监狱。
or someone put him in a prison.

1129
01:02:20,085 --> 01:02:21,440
你到底怎么了？
What is wrong with you?

1131
01:02:28,230 --> 01:02:31,370
监狱长很生气。
And the head of the jail was so mad.

1132
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:33,666
你到底怎么了！
What is wrong with you, huh?

1133
01:02:33,666 --> 01:02:37,230
你不知道他对我们做了什么吗？！
You do not know what he did to us?

1134
01:02:37,230 --> 01:02:39,750
你不爱你的父母，嗯？
You do not love your parents, huh?

1135
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,100
难道你忘了吗？
You forget?

1136
01:02:42,100 --> 01:02:44,165
我忘了在那里的那个人,
I forgot that the man was there,

1137
01:02:44,165 --> 01:02:46,620
实际上他也失去了家人。
and actually who lost his family, too.

1138
01:02:46,620 --> 01:02:47,910
我真的感到很难过。
And I really felt bad.

1139
01:02:47,910 --> 01:02:50,645
你宽恕了一个杀人犯？
You forgive a killer?

1140
01:02:50,645 --> 01:02:54,470
你到底怎么了？
What is wrong with you?

1141
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:57,170
你到底怎么了？
What is wrong with you?

1142
01:02:57,170 --> 01:02:59,190
天啊，我为什么要宽恕他？
Oh my God, why did I forgive him?

1143
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,050
但我做了，我想这么做。
But I did, I wanted to.

1144
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:03,380
我想让他得自由。
I wanted to free him.

1145
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:07,030
但这感觉更像是软弱，感觉像是，
But it felt more like weakness, it felt like,

1146
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:10,220
在某个地方，我知道我做的是对的。
somewhere I knew it was the right thing.

1147
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:12,890
这是最可怕的故事。
It's the most horrifying tale.

1148
01:03:12,890 --> 01:03:17,490
然而，她和许多经历过种族灭绝的人,
And yet, she and many people living through that genocide,

1149
01:03:17,490 --> 01:03:22,220
在他们的心中找到了宽恕和继续前进的信念。
have found it in their hearts to forgive and to move on.

1150
01:03:22,220 --> 01:03:24,230
宽恕就是一切。
Forgiveness is everything.

1152
01:03:28,210 --> 01:03:30,400
当我想到宽恕，
When I think of forgiveness, 

1153
01:03:30,400 --> 01:03:38,400
我就会为它的存在而感激涕零。
I'm brought to weep with gratitude that it exists.

1154
01:03:38,400 --> 01:03:40,110
宽恕并不意味着
Now, forgiveness doesn't mean that 

1155
01:03:40,110 --> 01:03:42,380
你会容忍别人的行为。
you're condoning someone else's behavior.

1156
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:44,780
这一点非常重要。
This is a really important point.

1157
01:03:44,780 --> 01:03:46,410
宽恕仅仅意味着
Forgiveness merely means that 

1158
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:48,270
你将自己从
you're freeing yourself up from 

1159
01:03:48,270 --> 01:03:50,720
你所持有的能量块、
the energy blocks that you're holding,

1160
01:03:50,720 --> 01:03:54,140
你所携带的怨恨中解放出来。
those resentments that you're carrying.

1161
01:03:54,140 --> 01:03:59,000
有一首歌，一首福音歌曲。
There's a song, a Gospel song.

1162
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:00,030
它这样唱到，
And it says, 

1162
01:04:00,0300 --> 01:04:05,330
把你的重担交给主，
take your burden to the Lord

1163
01:04:05,330 --> 01:04:07,670
把它们留在那里。
and leave them there.

1164
01:04:07,670 --> 01:04:11,730
把它们留在那里，哦，把它们留在那里。
Leave them there, oh, leave them there.

1165
01:04:11,730 --> 01:04:16,460
把你的重担交给主，把它们留在那里。
Take your burden to the Lord and leave them there.

1166
01:04:16,460 --> 01:04:18,933
如果你信祂，莫怀疑，
If you trust Him, never doubt, 

1166
01:04:18,933 --> 01:04:21,800
祂一定会带你出来。
he will surely bring you out.

1167
01:04:21,800 --> 01:04:25,410
把你的重担交给主，把它们留在那里，
Take your burden to the Lord and leave them-- now,

1168
01:04:25,410 --> 01:04:27,240
就是这样，有很多人
there is that, and there are people

1169
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:33,440
唱得如此热情，如此自信。
that sing that with such fervor and such confidence.

1170
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:36,140
而这些人也承担了他们的重担,
And those are the same people who take their burden,

1171
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,485
说我的重担在那里，
say there my burdens, 

1172
01:04:37,485 --> 01:04:39,985
然后他们站起来，带着负担走了。
and then they get up and take the burden with them.

1173
01:04:39,985 --> 01:04:42,590
然后他们..
And they go...

1174
01:04:42,590 --> 01:04:45,740
我们怎样才能与心相连呢？
How can we connect with the heart?

1175
01:04:45,740 --> 01:04:53,135
出发点就是你此时此刻拥有的一切。
Well, your starting point is all you ever have, this moment.

1177
01:04:56,550 --> 01:04:58,950
我们一直都很忙。
We are so busy all the time.

1178
01:04:58,950 --> 01:05:03,080
我们没有时间，没有空间，没有心的静默。
There's no time, no space, no silence for the heart.

1179
01:05:03,080 --> 01:05:06,590
除非你真的能到大自然中去,
Unless you actually can be out in nature,

1180
01:05:06,590 --> 01:05:09,530
感受鸟儿的歌唱，
and experience the birds singing, 

1181
01:05:09,530 --> 01:05:11,500
感受树木和蓝天，
and the trees and the blue sky, 

1182
01:05:11,500 --> 01:05:16,480
否则你就脱离了伟大的灵性存在，
you are divorced from the great spiritual being 

1182
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:18,680
而我觉得它就在我们周边
that I feel is all around us.

1183
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:20,720
而我是如此幸运，
And I've been so lucky to spend 

1184
01:05:20,720 --> 01:05:23,660
能在大自然中独自度过好几个月。
months and months on my own in nature.

1185
01:05:23,660 --> 01:05:27,000
然后你就能成为一个完整的人，
Then you can become a whole human being

1186
01:05:27,000 --> 01:05:30,944
有心、有脑、有灵魂,
with heart, and brain, and spirit,

1187
01:05:30,944 --> 01:05:33,230
相互联系，完整无缺。
all connected and whole.

1188
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,930
这就是为什么人们冥想或祈祷,
That's why maybe people meditate or pray,

1189
01:05:35,930 --> 01:05:38,800
因为他们需要那个空间、那个时刻
because they need that space, that moment 

1190
01:05:40,340 --> 01:05:43,080
去听从内心的声音。
when you listen to the heart.

1191
01:05:43,080 --> 01:05:48,690
每场风暴的中心都有一个肚脐大小的洞，
Every storm has a hole in the center the size of a navel

1192
01:05:48,690 --> 01:05:52,890
从中一只海鸥可以安静地飞过。
through which a gull can fly in silence.

1193
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:56,070
因此你变得平静。
And so you become calm.

1194
01:05:56,070 --> 01:05:59,100
你必须变得平静。
You must become calm.

1195
01:05:59,100 --> 01:06:04,060
如果你不知道该做什么，那就什么都不做。
If you don't know what to do, do nothing.

1196
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:10,890
不要用琐事来填满时间，什么也不要做。
Don't fill your time with trivia, simply do nothing.

1197
01:06:10,890 --> 01:06:12,880
坐下即好。
Simply sit.

1198
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:13,930
深呼吸。
Breathe.

1199
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:16,870
所有的传统都在讲
All the traditions speak about the value

1200
01:06:16,870 --> 01:06:19,300
冥想、反思和沉思的价值,
of meditation, reflection, contemplation,

1201
01:06:19,300 --> 01:06:21,530
它们都以呼吸为中心。
which all center on breathing.

1202
01:06:21,530 --> 01:06:22,330
为什么？
Why?

1203
01:06:22,330 --> 01:06:26,410
因为呼吸让我们回归当下的平安。
Because breath restores us to the safety of the moment.

1204
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:28,660
现在你要比平时呼吸得
Now you want to breathe a little deeper and a little

1205
01:06:28,660 --> 01:06:30,520
更深更慢一点。
slower than you normally would.

1206
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:33,215
吸气四五秒，
About a four or five second on the in-breath, 

1207
01:06:33,215 --> 01:06:35,030
呼气四五秒。
and four or five seconds on the out-breath.

1208
01:06:35,030 --> 01:06:36,256
不过不要屏住呼吸，你只是
But you don't hold your breath, 

1209
01:06:36,256 --> 01:06:38,220
找到一个好的节奏和速度，
you just get a nice rhythm, that pace, 

1210
01:06:38,220 --> 01:06:40,580
把你的紧张感保持在心脏的区域。
holding your tension in the area of the heart.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
1211
01:06:40,580 --> 01:06:43,130
把你的觉知带到你的心里。
Bring your awareness to your heart.

1212
01:06:43,130 --> 01:06:46,720
把你有意识的觉知带到你的心里。
Bring your conscious awareness into your heart.

1213
01:06:46,720 --> 01:06:55,040
也许你能听到。
And you may be able maybe to hear.

1214
01:06:55,040 --> 01:06:57,800
我一直向我的心祈求指引。
I ask my heart all the time for guidance.

1215
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,170
你的心有一个很好的方式来告诉你，
Your heart has a very good way to tell you 

1216
01:07:00,170 --> 01:07:03,290
你是否走在正确的道路上。
whether you're in a good path or not.

1217
01:07:03,290 --> 01:07:05,720
这就是所谓的热情。
It's called enthusiasm.

1218
01:07:05,720 --> 01:07:07,712
我让周围的一切进入我的内心，
I let in whatever's around me, 

1219
01:07:07,712 --> 01:07:14,310
我问自己，我现在的活力在哪里？
and I ask, where's the aliveness now?

1220
01:07:14,310 --> 01:07:16,220
当我和孩子们玩耍时，
When I'm playing with the kids, 

1220
01:07:16,220 --> 01:07:19,120
当我和丈夫做爱时，
when I make love to my husband, 

1221
01:07:19,120 --> 01:07:20,670
当我读一本好书的时候，
when I read a good book, 

1222
01:07:20,670 --> 01:07:23,380
当我写作的时候，我觉得那些角色
when I'm writing and I feel that the character 

1223
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,360
变成了一个个人，并和我说话，
becomes a person and talks to me, 

1224
01:07:26,360 --> 01:07:28,800
然后我的心也感觉飘飘然，
then my heart also feels fluttering, 

1224
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:33,000
充满欢笑，充满喜悦。
and with laughter,with joy.

1225
01:07:33,000 --> 01:07:35,700
为什么一切都要那么严肃呢？
Why everything has to be so serious?

1226
01:07:35,700 --> 01:07:38,565
玩得开心很重要。
It's very important to have fun.

1227
01:07:38,565 --> 01:07:42,600
即使是你正在做的事情中间，
Even the middle of something that you are doing that

1228
01:07:42,600 --> 01:07:45,240
需要有大量的纪律性。
requires a lot of discipline.

1229
01:07:45,240 --> 01:07:50,850
因此，连接你的心，成为一个孩子吧！
And so to connect to your heart, become a child.

1230
01:07:50,850 --> 01:07:53,160
我亲爱的朋友乔治来希腊了。
My dear friend George came to Greece.

1231
01:07:53,160 --> 01:07:54,950
这家伙是个亿万富翁。
This guy is a billionaire.

1232
01:07:54,950 --> 01:07:56,610
而且他块头很大。
And he is very big.

1233
01:07:56,610 --> 01:07:57,990
他开始和我说话，我说：
He started talking, and I said--

1234
01:07:57,990 --> 01:07:59,170
听着。
Listen.

1235
01:07:59,170 --> 01:08:01,410
如果你想要和我谈，就跟我来。
If you want to talk with me, come with me.

1236
01:08:01,410 --> 01:08:03,270
我带他去了雅典市中心，
I took him out in the central of Athens

1237
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,782
那里有蹦床。
where we have a trampoline.

1239
01:08:10,959 --> 01:08:12,350
伙计，除非你在蹦床上跟着我，
We're not going to talk business 

1240
01:08:12,350 --> 01:08:14,640
否则我不会和你谈生意的。
unless you follow me on the trampoline, man.

1241
01:08:14,640 --> 01:08:15,440
不，不，不，不。
No, no, no, no.

1242
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:16,939
来吧，来吧，伙计，我们一起跳。
Yes, yes, yes, together.

1243
01:08:16,939 --> 01:08:19,220
我才不要玩蹦床。
I'm not going on a trampoline.

1244
01:08:19,220 --> 01:08:21,640
脱掉你衣服和鞋子可真不容易啊，伙计。
You're a difficult guy to get undressed, man.

1246
01:08:27,467 --> 01:08:28,850
他这辈子
He came up on the trampoline 

1246
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:30,050
第一次玩蹦床,
for the first time in his life,

1247
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,500
我们开始一起跳，
and we started jumping together, 

1247
01:08:31,500 --> 01:08:33,890
上跳下跳，左蹦右蹦。
up and down, up and down.

1248
01:08:33,890 --> 01:08:37,510
他有140公斤，不是吗？
140 kilos, no?

1249
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,140
嘿，只要你稍微训练一下，
Hey, you could become a champion

1250
01:08:39,140 --> 01:08:40,299
你就可以成为冠军。
if you train a little bit.

1251
01:08:40,299 --> 01:08:41,810
参加下一届奥运会，好吗？
Next Olympic games, OK?

1252
01:08:41,810 --> 01:08:43,746
我来当你的经纪人！
I will be your manager, man!

1255
01:08:51,903 --> 01:08:53,319
哇，你真不赖，伙计！
Wow, what a good boy you are, man!

1256
01:08:53,319 --> 01:08:57,630
我就喜欢这样！
That's the way I like it!

1257
01:08:57,630 --> 01:09:00,029
他那么开心，像个小孩子。
He was so happy, like a little child.

1259
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:03,779
我们心中的小孩被藏起来了。
The child is hidden.

1260
01:09:03,779 --> 01:09:06,779
每个人都是孩子，即使他是亿万富翁。
Everybody's a child, even him, who is a billionaire.

1261
01:09:06,779 --> 01:09:11,080
孩子说，你好，我在这里。
And the child is saying, hello, I'm here.

1262
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,439
但是我们想，哦，我们已经长大了,
But we think, oh, we are grown up,

1263
01:09:14,439 --> 01:09:17,950
我们不会听这个孩子的。
we're not going to listen to this child.

1264
01:09:17,950 --> 01:09:24,220
因为这个孩子有幼稚的梦想。
Because this child has childish dreams.

1265
01:09:24,220 --> 01:09:27,470
所以我们忘记了孩子。
And so we forget the child.

1266
01:09:27,470 --> 01:09:30,189
从我们忘记孩子的那一刻起,
And from the moment that we forget the child,

1267
01:09:30,189 --> 01:09:33,100
我们认为孩子会忘记我们。
we think the child is going to forget us.

1268
01:09:33,100 --> 01:09:34,260
不是的。
No.

1269
01:09:34,260 --> 01:09:37,149
内在小孩是不会忘记我们的。
The child is not going to forget us.

1270
01:09:37,149 --> 01:09:39,669
这个孩子会一直在心里告诉我们：
This child will be here always, 

1270
01:09:39,669 --> 01:09:41,529
”你好，我在这里。
hello, I'm here.

1271
01:09:41,529 --> 01:09:42,790
我在跟你说话。
I'm talking to you.

1272
01:09:42,790 --> 01:09:44,279
你能听我说吗？“
Can you listen?

1273
01:09:44,279 --> 01:09:45,099
然后我们说：
And then we say, 

1273
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:47,699
“闭嘴。
shut up.

1274
01:09:47,699 --> 01:09:49,810
我不想听你的。“
I don't want to listen to you.

1275
01:09:49,810 --> 01:09:55,360
但是当你面对死亡的那一天,
But the day that you're facing death,

1276
01:09:55,360 --> 01:09:56,700
这个孩子会在那里，
this child will be there, 

1276
01:09:56,700 --> 01:09:59,360
再一次问你：
and are going to ask you again,

1277
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:02,890
“你为什么不听我的？”
why didn't you listen to me?

1278
01:10:02,890 --> 01:10:07,002
然后你必须回答。
And then you have to answer.

1279
01:10:07,002 --> 01:10:12,250
你的答案将决定你在地狱还是天堂。
And your answer will be your hell or your heaven.

1280
01:10:12,250 --> 01:10:17,950
幼稚和童真的区别
The difference between being childish and childlike

1281
01:10:17,950 --> 01:10:23,000
就是幼稚会减少你的心量，
is that being childish reduces our world 

1282
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:26,560
让我们变得以自我为中心。
and returns us to being self-centered.

1283
01:10:26,560 --> 01:10:31,610
童真让我们充满好奇心。
Being childlike returns us to wonder.

1284
01:10:31,610 --> 01:10:33,580
如果实践下面这个练习的话，
It's wonderful to be like a child

1285
01:10:33,580 --> 01:10:35,530
像个孩子一样是很美妙的。
if you still can practice this.

1286
01:10:35,530 --> 01:10:38,860
当我在新地方、新的城市或新地区时,
When I'm in new places, or new cities, or new areas,

1287
01:10:38,860 --> 01:10:40,600
我就像爱丽丝漫游仙境一样。
I'm as Alice in Wonderland.

1288
01:10:40,600 --> 01:10:42,520
然后心就又打开了。     
Then the heart goes open again.

1289
01:10:42,520 --> 01:10:45,160
我觉得我的心兴奋极了。
And then I feel my heart exploding.

1290
01:10:45,160 --> 01:10:48,060
我能感觉到心的热度。
You know, I feel the heat of the heart.

1291
01:10:48,060 --> 01:10:51,940
与心灵保持一致
And it is wonderfully liberating and empowering

1292
01:10:51,940 --> 01:10:54,800
是种奇妙的解放和赋能，
to be aligned with the heart, 

1293
01:10:54,800 --> 01:10:59,200
它是所有创造的基础。
that which underlies all creation.

1294
01:10:59,200 --> 01:11:04,460
就是在这个时候，你经常会发现有益的因素
And it is then that often you find helpful factors 

1295
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:07,770
突然闯入你的生活中，
coming into your life out of nowhere, 

1296
01:11:07,770 --> 01:11:11,390
而这些同步性事件
and those are synchronistic events that

1297
01:11:11,390 --> 01:11:14,060
通常是确认
usually are confirmation that 

1297
01:11:14,060 --> 01:11:17,860
你与更深源头的联系。
you are connected to that deeper level.

1298
01:11:17,860 --> 01:11:23,020
同步性这个词是卡尔·荣格创造的。
Synchronicity this word that was created by Carl Jung.

1299
01:11:23,020 --> 01:11:25,540
当事情看起来是巧合时,
When something appears to be a coincidence,

1300
01:11:25,540 --> 01:11:28,630
但你知道事情远非如此。
but you know that there's more to it than that.

1301
01:11:28,630 --> 01:11:32,920
例如，你在恰当的时间接到一个电话。
For example, you get a phone call just at the right moment.

1302
01:11:32,920 --> 01:11:35,800
一些有益于你的事情发生着，
Something that becomes helpful factor,

1303
01:11:35,800 --> 01:11:39,040
而你无法从因果关系上解释那是如何发生的。
and you cannot explain causally how that happened.

1304
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,280
同步性是个奇迹。
Synchronicity is a miracle.

1305
01:11:42,280 --> 01:11:44,380
你唯一能做的就是
The only thing that you can do is 

1305
01:11:44,380 --> 01:11:47,380
对同步性持开放态度。
to be open to synchronicity.

1306
01:11:47,380 --> 01:11:50,890
这就像一个过滤器掉了下来，
It is as if a filter drops away,

1307
01:11:50,890 --> 01:11:54,910
我们注意到同步性无处不在。
and we notice that synchronicity is all around us.

1308
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:58,620
这不是一个偶然的宇宙。
That this isn't an accidental universe.

1309
01:11:58,620 --> 01:12:02,100
当我们在等医生的消息时,
When we were waiting to hear from the doctors,

1310
01:12:02,100 --> 01:12:05,220
我拿着一件克里斯蒂娜的夹克。
I had one of Christina's jackets.

1311
01:12:05,220 --> 01:12:07,230
我把手伸进口袋，
And I reached into the pockets  

1312
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:11,610
从幸运饼干里拿出了一张幸运符。
and I pulled out a fortune from a fortune cookie.

1313
01:12:11,610 --> 01:12:16,955
里面写着“我们必须永远怀着旧时的记忆和年轻的希望”。
We must always have old memories and young hopes.

1315
01:12:19,515 --> 01:12:29,290
这对我们来说是她离开的信号。
And that was a sign for us that she was gone.

1316
01:12:29,290 --> 01:12:31,370
我立刻觉得这就像..
And immediately I just thought this was like--

1317
01:12:31,370 --> 01:12:32,590
最后一条信息。
A final message.

1318
01:12:32,590 --> 01:12:34,170
她给我们的最后信息。
Her final message to us.

1319
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:37,226
我的意思是，旧的记忆是
I mean, the old memories were the old memories 

1320
01:12:37,226 --> 01:12:40,760
与克里斯蒂娜的记忆。
with her, with Christina.

1321
01:12:40,760 --> 01:12:45,620
还有，年轻人的希望，或者乐观主义,
And the young hopes, or the optimism, 

1322
01:12:45,620 --> 01:12:46,810
她才21岁。
she was 21 years old.

1323
01:12:46,810 --> 01:12:49,040
她展望了她的整个人生。
She looked ahead to her whole life.

1324
01:12:49,040 --> 01:12:50,744
对我来说，这是在告诉我们，
To me it was telling us 

1325
01:12:50,744 --> 01:12:53,414
我们要继续她未竟的事业，
that we have to pick up where she left off, 

1325
01:12:53,414 --> 01:12:57,270
即使我已经不是21岁了。
even though I'm not 21 anymore.

1326
01:12:57,270 --> 01:13:00,000
我必须接受这种理念，
I have to adopt that philosophy 

1327
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:05,242
并努力不辜负年轻时对未来的期望，
and try to live up to the young hopes 

1328
01:13:05,242 --> 01:13:08,450
你可以拥有的，
for the future that you can have, 

1329
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,400
你可以在世界中有所作为。
and that you can make a difference in the world.

1330
01:13:10,400 --> 01:13:12,906
同步性很大程度上是由于直觉，
Synchronicity is largely due to intuition, 

1331
01:13:12,906 --> 01:13:15,540
我们最终在恰当的时间出现在恰当的地方，
where we end up in the right place at the right time 

1332
01:13:15,540 --> 01:13:18,410
因为我们有内心的指引。
because of that inner guidance.

1333
01:13:18,410 --> 01:13:20,000
在我们做的其他实验中，
In other experiments we've done, 

1334
01:13:20,000 --> 01:13:22,160
我们看到心可以
we see that the heart can know 

1335
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:25,520
提前20秒左右就知道信息。
the information about 20 seconds before hand.

1336
01:13:25,520 --> 01:13:27,200
但在现实生活中，我们的直觉
But in real life, our intuition's

1337
01:13:27,200 --> 01:13:29,660
不受这些实验方案的限制。
not limited by these experimental protocols.

1338
01:13:29,660 --> 01:13:31,400
我认为我们必须小心，不要说，
And I think we have to be careful not to say that,  

1339
01:13:31,400 --> 01:13:35,340
嗯，直觉只会发生在事件前20秒。
well, intuition is only 20 seconds before an event.

1341
01:13:35,340 --> 01:13:37,460
因为我们知道在现实世界中,
Because we know in the real world,

1342
01:13:37,460 --> 01:13:40,250
在一个事件真正发生之前，可能几小时，
it can be hours and sometimes even days

1343
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:42,410
有时甚至几天前，我们就有直觉。
before an event actually occurs.

1344
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:45,140
大多数人会立刻想到去拉斯维加斯，
Most people instantly think about going to Las Vegas

1345
01:13:45,140 --> 01:13:46,740
以及去参加赌博什么的。
and gambling or something.

1346
01:13:46,740 --> 01:13:49,070
如果直觉真的像我说的那样有效,
If intuition really works as I'm suggesting,

1347
01:13:49,070 --> 01:13:52,490
那真是我们自己的灵性在与我们合作。
it's really our own spirit working with us.

1348
01:13:52,490 --> 01:13:55,670
无论你怎么称呼它，我们的高我或
So it's not always in our best behalf from that interaction

1349
01:13:55,670 --> 01:13:57,372
我们的灵魂之间的互动
between our higher self, or our soul,

1350
01:13:57,372 --> 01:13:58,580
并不总是最符合我们的利益。
whatever you want to call it.

1351
01:13:58,580 --> 01:14:00,570
每种文化都有称呼直觉的说法。
Every culture has their own name for it.

1352
01:14:00,570 --> 01:14:03,230
我们去拉斯维加斯，总是赢。
That we go to Las Vegas and just win all the time.

1353
01:14:03,230 --> 01:14:05,660
直觉是我们最好的朋友。
So intuition is really our own best friend.

1354
01:14:05,660 --> 01:14:08,005
它真的是我们每时每刻的内在指导。
It's really the moment to moment inner guidance.

1355
01:14:08,005 --> 01:14:10,130
我们有过那种感觉，
You know, when we get that feeling that something's

1356
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:12,110
觉得有些事情不对劲，或者我们不该做什么。
just not right, or we shouldn't do something.

1357
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:14,540
也可以是一种积极的感觉，
Or it can be a positive feeling that we really

1358
01:14:14,540 --> 01:14:18,130
应该做些什么，或者去某个地方。
should do something, or go to a certain place.

1359
01:14:18,130 --> 01:14:20,890
我记得种族屠杀发生的前一天。
I remember the day before the genocide happened.

1360
01:14:20,890 --> 01:14:24,400
我哥哥回到家，他和朋友们待了一天,
My brother came home, he spent a day with his friends,

1361
01:14:24,400 --> 01:14:27,300
他告诉我们，他听到一个谣言，
and he told us that he heard a rumor 

1362
01:14:27,300 --> 01:14:30,740
说他们将在那天晚上杀光所有图西人。
that they were going to kill every Tutsi that night.

1363
01:14:30,740 --> 01:14:35,470
而我们，我们的家人，在名单列表上。
And we were, our family, on the list.

1364
01:14:35,470 --> 01:14:38,382
我不能仅仅因为你听到了一个谣言就让家人离开。
I cannot move the family just because you heard a rumor.

1365
01:14:38,382 --> 01:14:40,090
如果这是真的，到了早上..
What if it's true, and in the morning--

1366
01:14:40,090 --> 01:14:40,900
别说了。
Stop it.

1367
01:14:40,900 --> 01:14:41,700
不要害怕。
No fear.

1368
01:14:41,700 --> 01:14:44,085
相信上帝就好，忘了这个谣言吧。
Just trust in God and forget about it.

1370
01:14:47,410 --> 01:14:48,580
你觉得怎么样？
What do you think?

1371
01:14:48,580 --> 01:14:49,810
我们该走了。
We should move.

1372
01:14:49,810 --> 01:14:52,040
这很重要。
This is so important.

1373
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:54,040
10分钟就到了，我们可以直接坐船，
It's 10 minutes away, we can just take the boat,

1374
01:14:54,040 --> 01:14:55,910
如果没事的话，明早再来。
and come back in the morning if nothing.

1375
01:14:55,910 --> 01:14:59,440
我知道，但我们也必须相信我们的父亲。
I know, but we must trust our father, too.

1376
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:00,790
我知道，你说得对。
I know, you're right.

1377
01:15:00,790 --> 01:15:03,310
我们应该这么做，对吧？
We should, right?

1378
01:15:03,310 --> 01:15:05,530
因为他总是有很好的判断力。
Because he always has good judgment.

1379
01:15:05,530 --> 01:15:08,160
我们应该离开。
We should.

1380
01:15:08,160 --> 01:15:10,465
我心里很清楚，
It was so clear in my heart 

1381
01:15:10,465 --> 01:15:15,270
我的决定是离开这个国家。
that my decision was to move away from the country.

1382
01:15:15,270 --> 01:15:18,280
到了早上，一切都太迟了。
By the morning, it was too late.

1383
01:15:18,280 --> 01:15:22,050
他们封锁了所有的边境。
They had blocked all the borders.

1384
01:15:22,050 --> 01:15:26,370
这个教训彻底改变了我的心。
That lesson completely changed my heart forever.

1385
01:15:26,370 --> 01:15:30,090
当我有这种感觉的时候，我会倾听自己的心声,
Now when I have that feeling, I do listen to my heart,

1386
01:15:30,090 --> 01:15:31,890
而不管别人说什么。
no matter who is saying what.

1387
01:15:31,890 --> 01:15:34,960
我必须听从自己的内心。
I have to listen to my heart.

1388
01:15:34,960 --> 01:15:36,540
如果不相信心,
Well, if you don't trust the heart,

1389
01:15:36,540 --> 01:15:38,260
你要相信什么呢？
what are you going to trust?

1390
01:15:38,260 --> 01:15:45,600
我相信心是我们唯一可以信任的东西。
I believe the heart is the only thing we can trust.

1391
01:15:45,600 --> 01:15:48,420
当我们达到这样的地步，
When we get to the point where we have experienced

1392
01:15:48,420 --> 01:15:51,900
即我们经历了自己内心的转变，
this transformation within ourselves, 

1393
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:54,300
活在爱中而不是恐惧中，
where living from love rather than fear

1394
01:15:54,300 --> 01:15:57,510
改变了我们的生活环境,
has transformed our own life circumstances,

1395
01:15:57,510 --> 01:15:59,730
那么我们就成为了管道，成为了容器。
then we become channels, we become vessels.

1396
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:02,010
我们有道德权威，
We have the moral authority by which

1397
01:16:02,010 --> 01:16:04,380
可以为地球陈述这种可能性。
to state that possibility for the planet.

1398
01:16:04,380 --> 01:16:07,020
就在她去世前，我告诉她，
Just before she passed, I was telling her

1399
01:16:07,020 --> 01:16:10,980
我已经好几年没工作了,
that I'd been off work for a couple of years,

1400
01:16:10,980 --> 01:16:12,480
我们退休了。
and we retired.

1401
01:16:12,480 --> 01:16:15,150
我正在寻找有意义的
And I was kind of looking for something

1402
01:16:15,150 --> 01:16:17,730
事情来度过我的余生，
meaningful to do with the rest of my life,

1403
01:16:17,730 --> 01:16:19,980
因为我还年轻。
because I was still young.

1404
01:16:19,980 --> 01:16:23,060
她说，哦，总会找到的。
And she said, oh, something will come along.

1405
01:16:23,060 --> 01:16:27,480
到时候你就知道了。
You'll know it when it comes along.

1406
01:16:27,480 --> 01:16:30,270
她去世的时候，我立刻就知道了
And when she passed, I knew instantly

1407
01:16:30,270 --> 01:16:32,010
我们必须继续她的工作。
that we had to continue her work.

1408
01:16:32,010 --> 01:16:33,730
所以我们成立了基金会，
And so we started the foundation, 

1409
01:16:33,730 --> 01:16:36,810
克里斯蒂娜切斯特曼纪念基金会，
the Christina Chesterman Memorial Foundation, 

1410
01:16:36,810 --> 01:16:40,900
只是在她已经留下的遗产的基础上再接再厉。
to just build on the legacy that she left already.

1411
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,450
当你发自内心地生活时，
As you live from the heart 

1412
01:16:42,450 --> 01:16:45,130
越来越多的人开始发自内心地生活，
and more humans begin to live from the heart, 

1412
01:16:45,130 --> 01:16:48,510
这会产生连锁反应。
that has a ripple effect.

1413
01:16:48,510 --> 01:16:51,410
它从你所在的地方泛起涟漪，
It ripples out from where you are, 

1413
01:16:51,410 --> 01:16:53,280
然后再回到你身边。
and then you get it back.

1414
01:16:53,280 --> 01:16:55,380
每一天你都在努力。
Every day you work at it.

1415
01:16:55,380 --> 01:16:57,450
每一天你都要走到心里去。
Every day you go to the heart.

1416
01:16:57,450 --> 01:17:00,120
每天心都跟我说话。
Every day you speak to me.

1417
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:01,810
事实上，我每天早上都以
In fact, I start each morning 

1418
01:17:01,810 --> 01:17:03,600
我们所说的 "心锁 "起来。
with what we call a heart lock in.

1419
01:17:03,600 --> 01:17:06,900
只是连贯起来，真正向自己
Just getting coherent and really sending myself

1420
01:17:06,900 --> 01:17:08,850
发送几分钟的爱和欣赏，
love and appreciation for a few minutes,

1421
01:17:08,850 --> 01:17:11,640
从一个更连贯、更有条理、
to start my day from a more coherent,

1422
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:15,080
更有联系的角度开始我的一天。
composed, and connected perspective.

1423
01:17:15,080 --> 01:17:18,450
然后一整天你得重新启动它。
Then throughout the day you've got to kind of reboot that.

1424
01:17:18,450 --> 01:17:22,710
所以它确实在生命中形成了一种流动。
So really it's developing kind of a flow through life.

1425
01:17:22,710 --> 01:17:24,960
所有我称之为中间时刻的东西，
So all the in-between moments, as I call them,

1426
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,330
比如在这里和餐厅之间,
like in between here and the lunch room,

1427
01:17:27,330 --> 01:17:29,970
或者在这里和复印机之间。
or between here and the photocopier.

1428
01:17:29,970 --> 01:17:33,220
那些中间时刻是完美的机会，
Those in-between moments are perfect opportunities

1429
01:17:33,220 --> 01:17:35,314
让我们在欣赏中呼吸，
to breathe in that appreciation, 

1429
01:17:35,314 --> 01:17:37,974
或在内心的轻松状态中呼吸。
or that state of inner ease.

1430
01:17:37,974 --> 01:17:39,390
我的意思是，反正我们也得呼吸,
I mean, we have to breathe anyway,

1431
01:17:39,390 --> 01:17:42,330
所以我们不妨让它更有效。
so we might as well make it more effective.

1432
01:17:42,330 --> 01:17:46,680
如果我们足够冷静，
And if we can calm down enough,

1433
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:49,590
我们就可以聆听智慧。
we can listen to the wisdom.

1434
01:17:49,590 --> 01:17:55,060
我们学习如何成为好邻居、好访客。
We learn how to be good neighbors, good visitors.

1435
01:17:55,060 --> 01:17:57,136
如何成为好父母。
How to be good parents.

1436
01:17:57,136 --> 01:18:01,660
如何成为好员工，好老师。
How to be good workers, good teachers.

1437
01:18:01,660 --> 01:18:06,022
我们学习如何成为好公民。
We learn how to be good citizens.

1438
01:18:06,022 --> 01:18:08,402
善良的人类。
Good human beings.

1439
01:18:08,402 --> 01:18:12,210
因为我们倾听。
Because we listen.

1440
01:18:12,210 --> 01:18:15,370
不要试图把我们的声音放进去。
And not try to put our voices in it.

1441
01:18:15,370 --> 01:18:16,750
听就是了。
Just listen.

1442
01:18:16,750 --> 01:18:18,100
心是我的导师。
The heart is my guru.

1443
01:18:18,100 --> 01:18:21,910
在我见过的所有大师中，这位才是真正的大师。
For all gurus I've met, this one is the real one.

1444
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:24,380
问你的心任何问题。
Ask your heart any question.

1445
01:18:24,380 --> 01:18:25,480
我是谁？
Who am I?

1446
01:18:25,480 --> 01:18:26,480
我想要什么？
What do I want?

1447
01:18:26,480 --> 01:18:28,570
我的人生目标是什么？
What's my purpose in life?

1448
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:32,770
我在一个好朋友身上看重的品质是什么？
What are the qualities that I look for in a good friend?

1449
01:18:32,770 --> 01:18:35,580
在一段良好的关系中，
What are the qualities that I contribute to

1450
01:18:35,580 --> 01:18:37,630
我呈现出了哪些品质？
in a good relationship?

1451
01:18:37,630 --> 01:18:40,580
我的独特技能和才能是什么？
What are my unique skills and talents?

1452
01:18:40,580 --> 01:18:42,640
我该如何利用它为人类服务？
How do I use this to serve humanity?

1453
01:18:42,640 --> 01:18:44,628
你的心知道所有的答案。
Your heart knows all the answers.


1455
01:18:50,946 --> 01:18:52,510
我还是觉得很迷茫。
I still feel lost.

1457
01:18:55,690 --> 01:18:57,990
我不知道我的人生该怎么办了。
I don't know what to do with my life anymore.

1458
01:18:57,990 --> 01:18:59,935
把这个问题放在心上。
Take the question to your heart.

1459
01:18:59,935 --> 01:19:02,310
我一直都是。
I have been.

1460
01:19:02,310 --> 01:19:04,720
但我得不到任何答案。
I'm not getting any answers.

1461
01:19:04,720 --> 01:19:08,280
你只在想而已，它比实际情况更难。
You're thinking, it's harder than it really is.

1462
01:19:08,280 --> 01:19:11,490
只要跟随你心中的那份轻盈,
Just follow that lightness in your heart,

1463
01:19:11,490 --> 01:19:15,600
最终它将引领你走向有意义的人生。
and that will eventually lead you to a life of purpose.

1464
01:19:15,600 --> 01:19:17,725
我们心中的一些最大疑问就像
Some of the biggest questions of the heart 

1465
01:19:17,725 --> 01:19:21,180
一条路一样展开,而不是由答案铺就。
unfold as a path, not an answer.

1467
01:19:26,200 --> 01:19:28,215
追随我们的生命力，
Following our aliveness 

1468
01:19:28,215 --> 01:19:32,670
而不执著于它将成为什么。
without attaching what it will become.

1469
01:19:32,670 --> 01:19:34,480
不是为了成为诗人，
Not to become a poet, 

1470
01:19:34,480 --> 01:19:43,170
而是通过问题和生活的表达活出生命。
but I'm brought alive by the questions and the life of expression.

1471
01:19:43,170 --> 01:19:45,660
不是为了成为歌手，
Not to become a singer, 

1472
01:19:45,660 --> 01:19:51,700
而是通过从你身上发出的声音活出生命。
but to be brought alive by voice coming out of you.

1473
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:54,660
我们开始从中心去连接，
We begin to connect from our center 

1474
01:19:54,660 --> 01:19:58,250
而不仅仅是表面人格。
and not just from surface personality.

1475
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:01,190
这是一种完全不同的在世生活的方式。
It's a whole different way of moving through the world.

1476
01:20:01,190 --> 01:20:03,540
当一个人像这样在世界上穿梭时,
And when one moves through the world like this,

1477
01:20:03,540 --> 01:20:06,620
当我们开始像这样穿越世界时,
and when we begin to move through the world like this,

1478
01:20:06,620 --> 01:20:08,720
然后不断扩展的善的领域，
then the realm of ever expanding good, 

1479
01:20:08,720 --> 01:20:10,638
即天堂的另一个名字，
another name for heaven,

1479
01:20:10,638 --> 01:20:12,996
便开始显现在我们的星球上。
begins to be revealed on our planet.

1481
01:20:16,350 --> 01:20:22,020
我们看不到未来，但是心看到了它。
We cannot see tomorrow's sky, but the heart sees it.

1482
01:20:22,020 --> 01:20:24,160
我们将被指示
And we will be directed 

1483
01:20:24,160 --> 01:20:28,650
在未来应该如何行动。
as to how we should act in tomorrow's sky.

1484
01:20:28,650 --> 01:20:31,300
更有可能的是，我们已经知道了。
More than likely, we already know.

1485
01:20:31,300 --> 01:20:35,070
如果我们不知道，心会告诉我们，如果我们谛听的话。
But if we don't, the heart will tell us, if we listen.

1487
01:20:59,180 --> 01:21:02,117
这是给你的，亲爱的。
This is for you, sweetheart.
