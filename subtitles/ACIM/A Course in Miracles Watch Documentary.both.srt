and the scroll was wrapped around them,

open the scroll just enough to reveal the center panel.

232
00:11:35,966 --> 00:11:37,800

241
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,366

00:12:00,366 --> 00:12:02,633
before rolling up the scrolls sufficiently
以隐藏除中心面板之外的所有内容之前，

244
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,833

I am not interested in reading the past or the future

Helen prided herself as a research psychologist

that occurred throughout the summer of 1965.

she kept feeling that maybe she was losing her mind,

264
00:13:11,866 --> 00:13:15,466
as the summer and early fall began.

276
00:13:41,966 --> 00:13:44,833
But I said the only obvious thing

278
00:13:44,866 --> 00:13:46,900
Why don't you take down whatever it is,

279
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:50,166
you can read it to me tomorrow morning in the office.

00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:53,900
no one else ever has to know about it,

00:13:54,366 --> 00:13:56,266
but at least we'll know what it is,

The next morning Helen came in

and produce undreamed of changes in situations

Through miracles you accept god's forgiveness

by extending it to others.

00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:16,300
I would feel the writing coming on almost daily

but I could not sleep,

I got up in some disgust and wrote as directed.

I never knew when I started a sentence how it would end

so quickly that I had trouble keeping up with them.

where I stand on an issue depends on where I sit.

if we're going to accept that at face value,

but in fact it gives us a sense of direction,
