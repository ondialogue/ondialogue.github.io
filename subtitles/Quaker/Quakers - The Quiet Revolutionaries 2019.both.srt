00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,699
PNC 需要做出选择:
PNC has a choice to make:

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,466
投资未来。
invest in the future.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,400
这就是风能
And that's in wind energy

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,533
以及替代经济中的可再生能源。
and renewable energies in alternative economies.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,533
我去过无数次
I've been to countless

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,533
示威、游行、抗议和集会
demonstrations and marches and protests and rallys in

7
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:19,000
在我早期的时候，大部分时间都是和我爸爸一起。
various places and in my early days mostly with my dad.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,400
这对我意味着什么？
What is that meant for me?

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,100
我觉得这意味着这是一个我觉得很舒服的地方。
I think it means it's a place I feel really comfortable.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,866
这是一个让我感觉像在家里一样美好的地方，
It's a place I feel pretty at home

12
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:30,166
这也是我对民主的信仰之一。
and it's part of my belief of what democracy is about.

13
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:33,066
这是我对贵格会信仰的一部分。
It's part of my belief of what Quakerism is about.

14
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,766
我爸爸非常正直。
My dad has tremendous integrity.

15
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:38,466
他言出必行，
He practices what he preaches

16
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,533
他愿意冒这个险。
and he's willing to put it on the line.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,533
这些贵格会教徒是谁？
Who are these quakers?

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,766
是那个在桂格燕麦盒子上的家伙吗？
Is it that guy on the Quaker box?

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,966
贵格会教徒还戴着大帽子吗？
Do you still wear the big hats

20
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,933
还有大胡子吗？
and do you have the big, burly beards?

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,466
他们是阿米什人吗？
Are you like the Amish?

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,933
现在还坐马车吗？
Do you still ride in buggies?

23
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:08,066
现代贵格会与很久以前的有什么不同？
How are modern quakers different from long ago?

25
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:16,866
我的一些学生真的懂得平等和正直
Some of my students really know about equality and integrity

27
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:19,066
还有一些证词比如和平证词,
and some of the testimonies like peace testimony,

29
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,366
这对于今天的贵格会教徒来说是至关重要的。
that is fundamental to Quakers today.

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,133
过去是如何告知现在的，
How has the past informed the present

31
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:26,499
而现在又将如何告知未来？
and how will the present inform the future?

32
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,699
麦片盒上的贵格教徒其实是长老会教徒，
The Quaker on the cereal box is actually a Presbyterian

33
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,599
麦片公司决定使用贵格会的形象，
oatmeal company who decided to use a Quaker image

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
因为它让人关联到可靠性和质量。
because it's associated with reliability and quality.

35
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,899
在19世纪晚期,
This is in the late 19th century,

36
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:50,899
那时贵格会教徒已经非常融入社会,
by which time Quakers have become very integrated in society,

38
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,000
在商业上非常成功。
have become very successful at business.

39
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:56,766
到那时，贵格会教徒的形象就是在
And so by that point, the image of a Quaker would convey

40
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,899
传达质量、可靠性和完整性。
quality, reliability, integrity.

41
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:03,366
乔治·福克斯在1670年提出了一个
There's an advice from George fox stated 1670

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,733
不能赚取不正当的利润的建议,
about not making an undue profit,

43
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:08,799
但贵格会的价格很公道。
but they're being a fair price for something.

44
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,666
贵格会以固定的价格出售东西,
And so Quakers would sell things at a fixed price,

45
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,733
他们买东西的时候可不是小丑。
not haggar when they were buying things.

46
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,666
因为贵格会教徒的正直和诚实，
And this led to a great respect amongst the wider population

48
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,733
受到了广大民众极大的尊重。
for Quaker integrity and honesty.

49
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:24,466
人们开始信任贵格会教徒，并且说,
And people started to trust Quakers with their money and say,

51
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,566
“好吧，你能看管一下这个吗?”
"Well, will you look after this?",

52
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:27,399
因为他们知道他们会拿回来的。
because they knew they would get it back.

53
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,066
从那里，你得到了
And from that, you get

54
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,533
贵格会教徒参与了
Quakers being involved in the sort of

55
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,166
新兴的银行业。
nascent banking industry.

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,600
1915年,
In 1915,

57
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:39,966
实际上，教友派试图让国会通过一项法律
Friends actually tried to get a law through Congress

58
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:44,733
使用这个名字是违法的
which would have made it illegal to use the name

60
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:48,966
宗派作商业用途。
of a religious denomination for commercial purposes.

61
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,999
但不幸的是,
But unfortunately for Friends,

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,733
桂格燕麦公司有足够的游说力量否决这项法案。
Quaker Oats had enough lobbying power to kill the bill.

63
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,900
因此，贵格会继续是一个
And so Quaker continued to be a

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,800
相当有力的广告符号。
rather powerful advertising symbol.

66
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,699
我猜从19世纪末开始,
So I would guess since the late 19th century,

67
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,566
他们用数十亿美元赚了数十亿美元。
they've made billions on billions of dollars.

70
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,866
近400年来,
For nearly 400 years,

71
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:44,866
贵格会的领导者是他们基本的见证人:
Quakers have been led by their basic testimonies:

72
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:52,933
简单、和平、平等、完整、管理地球。
simplicity, peace, equality, integrity, stewardship of the earth.

76
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,166
向内看，他们受到神秘信仰的指引，
Inward looking, they are directed by the mystical belief

77
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,900
即每个人身上都有上帝的影子。
that there is that of God in every person.

78
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:07,099
他们也向外看，寻求改变世界。
They also look outward, seeking to change the world.

79
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,566
所有的贵格会教徒都不一样。
All quakers are not the same.

80
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:17,533
有无声的无结构化的贵格会议,
There are silent unprogrammed Quaker meetings,

81
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:23,366
也有福音贵格派教堂，里面有牧师和唱诗班。
but also Evangelical Quakered churches with pastors and choirs.

84
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,666
贵格会教徒分布在美洲、
Quakers are found in the Americas,

85
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:32,799
欧洲、中东、亚洲和太平洋。
Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific.

87
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,775
但是今天超过一半的
But today more than half of the Religious 

88
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,566
教友派成员居住在非洲。
Society of Friends live in Africa.

90
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:42,599
这种显著的增长始于1902年，
This remarkable growth began in 1902

91
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:47,500
当时福音派贵格会传教士从俄亥俄州前往肯尼亚。
when Evangelical Quaker missionaries from Ohio travel to Kenya.

93
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,299
尽管有这些不同形式的崇拜,
Despite these different forms of worship,

94
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,000
正是他们对和平的共同见证，
it is their common testimony to peace

95
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,666
将全世界的贵格会教徒团结在一起。
that unites Quakers throughout the world.

96
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,066
我去看了一部关于移除山顶的电影
I went to see a movie about mountaintop removal

97
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,899
有一次采访一位女士
coal mining and there was an interview with a woman

98
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,566
说她把孩子放进浴缸,
talking about when she puts her child in a bathtub,

99
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:07,099
她知道水里有砒霜。
she knows that there's arsenic in that water.

100
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,666
我在想,
And I'm thinking,

101
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,299
“让我们做一个非暴力的直接行动运动”。
"Let's do a nonviolent direct action campaign".

102
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,666
这是贵格会教徒的基因。
This is something that's in Quaker DNA.

102
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,314
结束种族隔离。
That segregation be ended...

103
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,866
我们以前做过。
We've done it before.

104
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,733
我们可以再来一次。
We can do it again.

105
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,999
新泽西州的骄傲女儿，爱丽丝 · 保罗,
It took a proud daughter of New Jersey, Alice Paul,

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,166
多年来组织游行
years of organizing marches

107
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,499
绝食抗议
and hunger strikes and protests

109
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,466
起草数百份法案
and drafting hundreds of pieces of legislation

110
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,133
写信和演讲
and writing letters and giving speeches

111
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,866
和国会领导人合作
and working with congressional leaders

112
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:37,387
直到她和其他妇女参政论者
before she and other suffragists finally 

114
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,700
帮助妇女赢得选举权。
helped win women the right to vote.

115
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,474
如果你把
If you were to put together 

116
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,666
美国活动家的名人堂,
a kind of hall of fame of American activists,

117
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,999
无论是和平运动,
whether it be the peace movement,

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,133
无论是妇女选举权还是废奴主义,
whether it be women's suffrage or abolitionism,

120
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,599
当你看到这些名字的时候真的很震撼,
it really is striking when you look at those names,

121
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,266
他们中有多少人自己也是贵格会教徒
how many of them either were themselves Quakers

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,866
或者受贵格会教徒原则影响的人。
or who were influenced by Quaker principles.

123
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,266
我不知道贵格会教徒
I'm not sure if Quakers would have

124
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,066
会不会自称为革命者，
described themselves as revolutionaries

125
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:11,338
但他们肯定在努力
but they're certainly trying to 

126
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,533
在人间建立神的国。
establish the kingdom of God on earth.

127
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,899
他们相信天堂将建立在人间。
They believe that heaven will be established on earth.

128
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:20,566
这是一场属灵的战争，他们称之为羔羊之战,
It's a spiritual warfare, what they call the Lamb's War,

129
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,599
提到了启示录。
a reference to the book of Revelation.

130
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,304
乔治 · 福克斯加入了这个组织
George Fox came into this group 

131
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,500
被视为潜在的领导者和预言家。
and was seen as a potential leader and a prophetic voice.

133
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,499
据我们所知,
From what we can gather,

134
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,133
他很有魅力。
he was very charismatic.

135
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:34,766
他身材魁梧,
He was a tall,

136
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,266
是个非常强壮的男人,
very powerfully-built man,

137
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:39,099
我想人们已经准备好听他的了。
and I think people were prepared to listen to him.

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,733
他赢得了他们的支持。
And he won them over.

139
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,699
他很快就说服了很多人。
He convinced many people quite quickly.

140
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:48,199
1652年 乔治 · 福克斯来到彭德尔山，
In 1652, George fox comes here to pendle hill and

141
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,933
说他被上帝感动了
says he's moved by the lord

142
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,766
他有一个伟大的愿景，一个伟大的人民将被聚集。
and he has a vision of a great people to be gathered.

143
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,030
我们可以把那个愿景
We could really date that vision 

144
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,900
视为贵格会的开端,
as the beginning of Quakerism,

145
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,966
作为教堂，作为运动。
as a church, as a movement.

146
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,633
他发现
And what he discovers is that 

147
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:04,133
他可以和上帝有直接的关系。
he can have a direct relationship with God.

148
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:06,799
这是贵格会的基础
And this is really foundational for Quakerism

149
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,666
成为基本的信仰,
and becomes the fundamental belief,

150
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,733
他们不需要牧师或者书
that they don't need a minister or a book

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,200
来告诉他们上帝的旨意。
to tell them what is of God.

153
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:18,000
基本上，每个人都是牧师,
Everybody is to be a minister, essentially,

155
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,200
这是一个非常开放和普遍的信息
It's a very open and universal message

156
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,166
英格兰人民正在经历一些新的事情。
that something new is happening for the people of England.

158
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,300
贵格会教徒当然是历史性的和平教会运动的一部分
Quakers of course are part of the historic peace church movement

160
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,716
门诺派教徒和弟兄们,
with Mennonites and Brethren,

161
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:34,866
他们是民权运动的一部分,
they've been part of the civil rights movement,

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,166
他们有时是甘地和公民抗命的追随者。
they've been followers of Gandhi and civil disobedience at times.

165
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,364
他们在请愿和游说中扮演了关键角色
And they've been key in the role of petition and lobby 

167
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:48,900
在三个半世纪里试图改变政府的想法
to try and change government minds over 3 and 1/2 centuries

168
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,733
贵格会的基本原则
The basic principles of Quakerism  

169
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:56,799
最初没有包括和平主义或和平证词，
did not initially include pacifism or the peace testimony

170
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:59,799
但很快它就成为了核心信仰之一，
but soon it became one of the core beliefs

171
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,600
这对早期贵格会教徒来说是没有商量余地的。
that was not negotiable to the early Quakers.

172
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:07,459
人们普遍怀疑我是
I am generally suspected to be 

173
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,800
一个破坏国家和平的普通人,
a common disturber of the nation's peace,

174
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,533
“国王的敌人，我,
"An enemy to the king and that I,

175
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,533
和其他人一起努力煽动起义
with others endeavor to raise insurrections

176
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,566
让整个国家陷入血海深渊”
to embroil the nation in blood",

177
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:20,166
”这一切都是假的,
"All of which is utterly false,

178
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,099
我在每个方面都否认,
and I do in every part deny it,

179
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:26,366
因为我的武器是精神武器,
for my weapons are spiritual,

180
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:30,566
它们带走了战争的机会，带来了和平”。
which take away the occasion of war and lead into peace".

181
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,366
1650年，他因布道而被带到法庭。
He was brought before the court for his preaching in 1650.

183
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,300
即便如此，他仍被视为一个危险的传教士。
Even then, he is seen as a dangerous preacher.

184
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,733
于是法官对他说,
And so the judge says to him,

185
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,533
“你不在上帝面前颤抖吗?”。
"Do you not quake before God?".

186
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,933
乔治 · 福克斯说,
And George Fox says,

187
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:48,466
“是的，你也应该这样”。
"Yes, you should as well".

188
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,799
它被看作是一个被称为贵格会教徒的贬义词,
And it was seen as a derogatory named to be called a Quaker,

189
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,369
实际上是20世纪早期
and it was really the early 20th century 

190
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,966
在贵格会教徒开始思考之前,
before Quaker started to think,

191
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,766
“好吧，我们承认”。
"All right, well, we'll own it".

192
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,700
“我们是贵格会”。
You know, "We'll be Quakers".

193
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:02,599
所以这就是..,
And so this is where this...

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,166
我们现在都是快乐的贵格会教徒,
and we are all happily Quakers now,

195
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,800
但我敢说如果你回到18世纪,
but I dare say if you've gone back to the 18th century,

197
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,333
他们肯定不会乐意成为贵格会信徒。
they would most certainly not have been happy about being Quakers.

199
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,700
他们是教友派。
They were the Religious Society of Friends.

200
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,666
福克斯认为在上帝眼中，女人和男人是平等的。
Fox saw women as equal to men in the eyes of God.

201
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,399
女人和男人一样，可以当牧师,
Women, like men, could be ministers,

202
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,799
可以公开表达他们的信仰。
speaking publicly for their faith.

203
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,166
这是给我的大礼
That's been a huge gift to me

204
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,133
贵格会的女人有多么强大,
is how powerful women are in Quakerism,

205
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,599
女人的力量没有..。
and that the power of women has not...

207
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,399
至少以我的经验来看,
at least in my experience been held down,

208
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,499
但是很受欢迎。
but been really welcomed.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
所以学习作为一个贵格会女权主义者意味着什么...
So learning what it means to be a Quaker feminist...

210
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,100
但我有一些很棒的老师。
but I had some great teachers.

211
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,566
玛格丽特 · 费尔是贵格会早期的关键领袖之一
Margaret Fell is one of the key early Quaker leaders

212
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:50,933
也是早期贵格会运动中
and a symbol of women's leadership 

213
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:52,599
女性领导力的一种象征。
in the early Quaker movement.

214
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,466
她写书信和小册子，
She writes letters and tracts

215
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:58,799
神学上复杂且非常引人注目。
theologically sophisticated and very compelling.

216
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,400
她写了一篇名为《女性说话是有道理的》的文章,
She wrote one called "Women's speaking justified",

217
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,600
主张妇女有传教的权利。
arguing for the right of women to preach.

218
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,566
她在斯沃斯莫尔大厅的家中
She provided a safe haven

219
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,500
提供了一个安全的避风港，
at her home at Swarthmore hall,

220
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:13,299
为乔治·福克斯和其他人提供了经济支持和援助。
financial support and assistance to George fox and others.

222
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:17,566
我的感觉是，如果玛格丽特・费尔没有站出来
My feeling is that if Margaret Fell had not stepped forward

224
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,733
提供的各种物质支持,
with the kinds of material support that she provided,

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,600
乔治 · 福克斯不太可能会成功。
that it's unlikely that George Fox could have succeeded.

226
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,166
她自己也被关进了监狱。
She herself is put into jail.

227
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,933
她一度失去了一块土地。
She has a land stripped away from her at one point.

228
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:31,466
她说，
And she says,

229
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,733
“虽然我不再受国王的保护,
"Although I'm no longer under the king's protection,

230
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,266
我知道我在上帝的脚下。
I know I'm under God's".

231
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:38,266
一般来说，我觉得女传教士的日子确实不好过,
Generally, I think the women preachers did have a tougher time,

233
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:41,766
因为，当然，女人自己说教是不寻常的。
because, of course, women preaching themselves was unusual.

235
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,700
贵格会带来的颤抖和震动
The trembling and shaking that came with Quakerism

236
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:49,266
被认为是某种危险的歇斯底里症。
was seen to be some kind of dangerous hysteria.

237
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:54,199
一些贵格会教徒受到的惩罚之一
One of the punishments which some Quakers

238
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,100
会受到..。
would have been subjected to...

239
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,566
尤其是贵格会的女人会成为骂人的缰绳。
and in particular, Quaker women would be the scold's bridle.

241
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:03,599
本质上，它是一个笼子
And essentially, it is a cage

242
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,399
适合这个人的头。
that fits over the person's head.

243
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,166
里面有根金属棒，穿过舌头。
With a metal bar inside that goes over the tongue.

244
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,866
他们会被带到集市上
They would be taken to the marketplace

245
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,066
当另一个人引导他们的时候。
as the other person led them around.

246
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:21,966
他们正在拉动使笼子移动的链条。
They were pulling on the chain which made the cage move.

247
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
随着它的移动，金属棒在嘴里移动,
And as it moved, the metal bar moved inside the mouth,

248
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,966
也就是说牙齿断了,
which meant that teeth were broken,

249
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:31,466
下巴偶尔被打断，痛苦不堪。
jaws were occasionally broken, absolute agony.

250
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,800
成百上千的贵格会信徒,
The followers of Quakerism, hundreds of them,

251
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,200
将被关押在兰开斯特监狱的公共休息室。
would be held in the common room in Lancaster Prison.

252
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,933
他们会互相交谈。
They would speak to each other.

253
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:44,366
他们将在他们自己之间建立
They would create among themselves

256
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:50,333
一种非常强大的团结，以抵抗政府。
a very strong solidarity of resistance to the government.

258
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:56,466
我认为在贵格会主义中
Something that I think has been

260
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,100
已经犯下了几个世纪的事情，
perpetrated through the centuries in Quakerism,

261
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,387
这可以追溯到1600年代后期
and that goes back to the common room 

262
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:05,333
兰开斯特监狱的公共休息室。
at Lancaster prison in the late 1600s.

265
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,466
在这30年里，大概有一万一千人被关进监狱，
Probably about 11,000 a put in prison during this time

266
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,933
有400多人死在里面。
and over 400 die in prison in those 3 decades.

267
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,366
他们因此而发展起来的
The strong solidarity they developed

268
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:20,566
强烈团结，使他们以
as a result of this carried them

270
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:25,366
更大的宗教决心进入美国。
onward into America with even more religious resolve.

271
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,933
他们在英国监狱中的肮脏、
Their experience in English prisons filthy,

272
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:31,666
拥挤而危险的经历
crowded and dangerous

273
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:35,133
引导他们参与重建监狱改革,
led them to join in the recreation of prison reform,

274
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,300
首先是在费城的胡桃街监狱
first in Philadelphia's, Walnut Street Jail

275
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,266
然后在城市的巨大东州教养所里。
and then in the city's massive Eastern State Penitentiary.

277
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,866
他们引入了单人囚犯监禁的概念，
They introduced the concept of single prisoner

278
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:55,566
每个牢房都有一盏灯，
confinement with a light in each cell

279
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,699
从天花板上开个小孔,
from a small opening in this ceiling,

280
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:02,133
表明囚犯可以从暴露于神圣中受益。
suggesting the prisoner could benefit from exposure to the Divine.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,966
他们牢房里只有一本圣经,
The only book in their cell was a bible,

283
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:10,966
让他们祈求宽恕，和解过去，并重新开始。
to pray for forgiveness, reconcile their past and start anew.

285
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,527
这个解决方案可能对贵格会教徒有效,
This solution may have worked for Quakers, 

286
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,496
但许多发现自己被隔离了数周、
but many others who found themselves isolated 

287
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:22,733
数月和数年的人认为这是精神上的折磨。
for weeks, months and years saw it as mental torture.

289
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:26,499
这是一个有着意想不到后果的弥天大谎。
This was a whopper of an unintended consequence.

290
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:30,766
然而，现在仍然有成千上万的男人和女人
Yet there are still now tens of thousands of men and women

292
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:34,999
被关在美国监狱的禁闭室里。
shut away in solitary confinement in American prisons.

293
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,400
大多数美国人可能会
Most people in the United States would probably

294
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,699
把贵格会教徒的集中与特拉华山谷联系起来。
associate the concentration of Quakers with the Delaware Valley.

296
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,900
宾夕法尼亚州，费城。
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

297
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,333
但是有大量的贵格会教徒
But there were large numbers of Quakers 

299
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:49,099
早在17世纪60年代的 Carolinas。
in the Carolinas already in the 1660s.

300
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:56,099
他们是为了逃避新英格兰贵格会教徒的迫害。
They were escaping the persecutions of Qakers in New England.

302
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,366
清教徒不是贵格会的忠实粉丝。
Puritans weren't big fans of Quakers.

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,800
贵格会教徒不交教会的什一税。
Quakers didn't pay their church tithes.

304
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,366
他们不支持神职人员。
They didn't support the ordain clergy.

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,666
因为他们的证词，他们不会在民兵组织服役。
They wouldn't serve in the militia because of their testimonies.

307
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,133
所以他们在新英格兰不太受欢迎。
So they weren't much welcome in New England.

308
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:16,533
事实上，在1660年，有四个教友被绞死
And in fact, in 1660, four quakers were hanged

309
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,199
仅仅因为他是贵格会教徒。
on Boston Common simply for being Quaker.

310
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,533
不是贵格会教徒心怀怨恨,
Not the quakers bear grudges,

311
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:22,627
但我们还是可以给它们起名字:
but we can still name them: 

312
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,799
玛丽・戴尔，威廉·罗便臣
Mary Dyer, William Robinson,

313
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,466
威廉·莱德拉和马尔马杜克·斯蒂芬森。
William Leddra and Marmaduke Stephenson.

314
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:36,207
一些早期的殖民地开放接受其他信仰,
Some early colonies were opened to accepting other faiths,

315
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,366
比如新英格兰的罗德岛,
like Rhode Island in New England,

316
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,533
在南部和北部罗来纳州也更加欢迎。
in the South, North Carolina was also more welcoming.

317
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,933
然后是宾夕法尼亚州,
And then there was Pennsylvania,

318
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:48,533
由威廉·佩恩于1681年创立。
founded by William Penn in 1681.

319
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,060
佩恩和其他早期的教友都不一样。
Penn is very unlike any of the other early Friends.

320
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,266
他家境富裕。
He's from a well-to-do background.

321
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:02,000
他的父亲是海军上将，在贵族圈子里活动。
His father is an admiral and moving in aristocratic circles.

323
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,166
他在牛津大学接受教育,
He is educated at Oxford,

324
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,266
但他在牛津的时候,
but whilst his at Oxford, 

325
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:11,399
开始接受一些激进的宗教思想。
starts to pick up some radical religious ideas.

326
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,600
他父亲对此很不高兴,
And his father's not very happy about this,

327
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,666
让他离开了牛津。
takes him out of Oxford.

328
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,400
在英国公开宣扬和
It was against the law

329
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,733
捍卫贵格会是违法的。
to publicly preach and defend quakerism in England.

330
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,000
佩恩被关进监狱4次。
Penn was sent to prison 4 times.

331
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:28,133
他最著名的书《没有十字架，就没有王冠》，
His most famous book, "No cross, no crown",

332
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,366
其中他告诫国王,
in which he admonishes the king,

333
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,899
该书写于1668年，
was written in 1668

334
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,866
当时佩恩在伦敦塔服刑。
while serving a sentence in the Tower of London.

335
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,066
作为对他父亲佩恩海军上将的债务的偿还，
As a repayment of a debt to his father, Admiral Penn,

336
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,843
查理二世将现在我们所知的
Charles II grants the land that now we know 

338
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:48,700
宾州的土地授予威廉·佩恩，
as Pennsylvania to William Penn,

339
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,900
于是佩恩就成了宾州的所有者。
and he becomes the proprietor of Pennsylvania.

340
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:59,924
为什么一个国王会在这个特定的时间
Why would a king grant this much territory

342
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:03,000
把这么多的领土赐给一个人呢？
to one person at this particular time?

343
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,300
其中一个理论是，
And one of the theories is that

344
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,065
如果这些麻烦的
they would have been very happy 

345
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:09,367
贵格会教徒收拾行装离开英国，
if these troublesome Quakers would have packed up 

346
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,300
他们会非常高兴的。
and left England.

347
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,366
根据一些说法，
By some accounts,

348
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,506
威廉·佩恩在1681年成为
William Penn becomes, in 1681, 

349
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:18,666
世界上最大的私人土地所有者。
the largest private landowner in the world.

350
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,966
佩恩进行了我们称之为「神圣实验」的事情,
Penn sets up what we would call the Holy Experiment,

351
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:28,133
即渴望建立一个以敬虔原则为基础的国家，
a desire to have a state that's run on Godly principles,

352
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,866
在那里宗教宽容是有保证的。
where religious toleration is guaranteed.

353
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:34,933
佩恩的政府框架
Penn's frame of government

354
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,266
给予重要的宗教自由,
granted significant religious freedom,

355
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:40,533
虽然不能保证所有人的公民自由。
though not with a guarantee of civil liberties for all.

356
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,799
投票和任职
Voting and office-holding

357
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:45,399
仅限于白人男性基督徒。
were restricted to white male Christians.

358
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,666
佩恩将他对宽容的信念
Penn extended his belief in toleration

359
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,699
扩展到了与印第安人的关系上。
to relations with the Indians.

360
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,533
他会见了部落首领,
He met with tribal leaders,

361
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:56,333
尊重美洲原住民在土地上生活的权利,
respected the rights of Native Americans to live on the land,

363
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:59,099
并支付从他们那里购买的土地。
and paid for the land purchased from them.

364
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:05,366
遗憾的是，这个崇高的愿景并没有实现。
Sadly, that lofty vision was not to be fulfilled.

365
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,700
贵格会教徒发现自己无法
Quakers found themselves unable

366
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,400
控制其他来宾夕法尼亚州的人,
to control others who came to Pennsylvania,

367
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:14,133
他们渴望土地，最终完全退出了
hungry for land and finally withdrew all together

369
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,699
执行这些早期条约的努力。
from trying to enforce those early treaties.

370
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,666
宾夕法尼亚不是一个和平的王国，
Pennsylvania was not the peaceable kingdom

371
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,806
佩恩本人对这个地方的
and Penn himself was quite disappointed 

372
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:24,442
发展方式感到非常失望。
in the way the place developed.

372
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:25,892
它的发展或多或少
It developed more or less like

373
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,515
像许多其他政治社区一样，在金钱和土地以及
lots of other political communities with factions and disputes 

374
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,566
以及其他所有方面存在派系、争端和争论。
and arguments over money and land and all the rest.

376
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,916
威廉 · 佩恩是他那个时代的人，拥有大约9个奴隶。
William Penn was a man of his time and owned about 9 slaves.

377
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:41,800
我们只知道他至少给了一个叫雅菲 的人自由。
We only know that he gave at least one named Yaffe  his freedom.

379
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,599
佩恩死前30年,
30 years before Penn's death,

380
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,666
一些贵格会教徒已经开始公开反对奴隶制。
some Quakers had already begun speaking out against slavery.

381
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,938
- 想试试吗?     - 当然。
- Wanna try?	 -  Sure.

382
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:59,099
几乎从一开始，贵格会教徒就认为奴隶分享内在的光。
Almost at the outset quakers saw slaves as sharing the inner light.

384
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,100
值得注意的是，威廉 · 佩恩只在
Remarkably, William Penn spent only

385
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,499
他心爱的宾夕法尼亚州待了4年。
4 years in his beloved Pennsylvania.

386
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,400
1702年，美国和爱尔兰关于土地权利的
Legal conflicts over land rights in America and Ireland

387
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:16,399
法律冲突使他回到了英国。
brought him back to England in 1702.

388
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:21,566
1718年，佩恩死于债台高筑，享年73岁。
He died in extreme debt in 1718 at the age of 73.

390
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,200
但他对美国未来宽容、平等和
But his influence on America's future path of tolerance

391
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,733
自由道路的影响是不可估量的。
equality and freedom was immeasurable.

392
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,933
即使贵格会获得了权力，也有一种反应:
Even as quakers gained power, there was a reaction:

393
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,699
最安静的时期,
the Quietest period,

394
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:40,933
受到贵格会教徒的驱使，他们现在变得更加排外和严格。
driven by Quakers who now became more exclusive and restrictive.

396
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,566
大多数历史学家研究的是最安静时期的开端
Most historians look at the beginning of the Quietest period

398
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,966
是在17世纪晚期出现,
coming around at late 1600s,

400
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:52,866
一直持续到19世纪中叶,
early 1700s and lasting into the middle of the 1800s,

402
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,899
大约持续了150年。
about 150 year period.

403
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,999
他们不允许和非贵格会教徒结婚。
And marrying out or marrying a non-Quaker was not allowed.

405
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,673
这是不能获许的罪行,
 It was a disown-able offense,

406
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,499
如果有人违反了此规则,
or it was something that if you did,

407
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:06,699
就会被开除会员资格。
then you could be dropped from your membership.

408
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:10,733
多莉·佩恩，更广为人知的名字是多莉·麦迪逊，
Dolley Payne,  who's more properly known as Dolly Madison,

409
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:15,533
出生于北卡罗来纳州新花园的一个贵格会家庭。
was born into a Quaker family in New Garden, North Carolina.

411
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,466
多莉的第一任丈夫是贵格会教徒,
Her first husband was a Quaker,

412
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:21,000
死于黄热病。
and then her husband died of the yellow fever.

414
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:23,933
多莉再婚后,
And when she remarried,

415
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:27,166
嫁给了一个非贵格会教徒，詹姆斯 · 麦迪逊,
she married a non-Quaker, James Madison,

416
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,166
之后多莉被开除了会员资格。
and she was dropped from membership.

417
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:33,866
但她确实在她的一生中
But she did maintain an affection

419
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,499
都保持着对友朋会的感情。
for the Society of Friends throughout her life.

420
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,300
如果你看看她的画像，
Although she didn't dress overly Quakerly,

421
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,166
她穿得不太像贵格会教徒。
if you take a look at her portraits.

422
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:42,399
她穿着很时髦，
She was quite fashionable

423
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:45,899
在白宫也是出了名的女主人。
and was known as quite a hostess in the White House.

424
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,666
就像最安静的人应该结婚一样,
Just as the Quietest supposed marrying out,

425
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,600
他们严格的信仰甚至禁止艺术、音乐和小说。
their strict beliefs even banned art, music and fiction.

426
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,566
厌恶艺术、厌恶音乐并不新鲜。
The aversion to art, to music is not new.

427
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:02,733
早期的贵格会教徒对此非常坚决。
Early Quakers were very very firm on this.

428
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,299
过了好几个世纪，
It took many centuries before

429
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:10,533
贵格会才开始对小说产生兴趣。
Friends started to warm up even to novels.

430
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:13,266
伟大的废奴主义者露迪雅 · 莫特
The great abolitionist Lucretia Mott

431
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,266
即使欣赏作者的作品，
would not read "Uncle Tom's cabin" even though

432
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:19,066
也不会读《汤姆叔叔的小屋》，
she admired the work of the author,

433
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,466
因为它是一部小说，不是真的故事。
because it was a novel and it was not true.

434
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,100
所以我们正在进化。
So we are evolving from that.

435
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,099
在这寂静中,
Here in this silence,

436
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,733
人们等待着神圣的指引来说话。
people wait for a leading from the Divine to speak.

437
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,866
他们没有牧师。
There is no pastor.

438
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,566
每个人都是牧师，并分担这一角色的职责。
Everyone is a minister and shares that responsibility.

440
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,399
到我天父的家园里。
Come into my Father's house.

442
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,166
到上帝的家园里
Come into God's house.

443
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,699
他欢迎各种各样的人:
And he welcomed people of all types:

445
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,466
不完美的人，罪人...
imperfect people, sinners...

447
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:13,933
他欢迎所有人来到上帝的殿堂。
He welcomed all into God's house.

448
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:20,366
我是个老师，
I am a teacher

449
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:25,133
我经常教我的学生，
and I often teach my students that part of respect

450
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,733
尊重包括学会相互信任、
is learning to trust one another

452
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:32,133
也包括你应该信任你的邻居。
and that you should be able to trust your neighbor.

453
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,533
建立信任需要很长时间，
Trust takes a long time to build

454
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,733
但摧毁信任似乎很容易。
and it seems like it's all too easy to destroy.

455
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,133
我们有一部分人
We have a certain segment of our population

456
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,866
发现恐惧是一种
that has discovered fear as a commodity

457
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:54,333
定期向公众推销的商品。
which is marketed regularly to the general public.

459
00:21:55,766 --> 00:22:00,733
我是艾米 · 凯利，来自敬拜和事工委员会。
I'm Amy Kelly from the Committee On Worship and Ministry.

461
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:04,533
我想我们今天可能有一些访客在这里，
And I think we probably have some visitors here today

462
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,657
愿意告诉我们你是谁、
who'd like to tell us who you are 

463
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:08,666
来自哪里，这样我们才能问候你。
and where you're from so we can greet you.

464
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:11,600
嗨，朋友们，我的名字是阿里穆塔尔。
Hi, friends, my name is Ali Mutar.

466
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:14,699
我要去 Old Chatham Friends 开会。
My meeting is an Old Chatham Friends meeting in New York.

468
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,933
我要去普林斯顿大学读博士了,
But I'm starting my PhD here at Princeton,

469
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:21,799
在那里呆5 ~ 7年。
so I'll be here for 5~7 years.

470
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:22,540
没关系。
It's fine.

471
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,475
我很期待...
I'm quite excited to...

472
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,133
我们可能会占有你一段时间。
We might claim you for a while.

473
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:28,079
是的，是的，没错，没错。
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

474
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:35,199
很多自以为是贵格会教徒的人。
Many people who think they've got Quakerism figured out...

475
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,866
然后参加一个典型的贵格会会议
and then visit a typical Quaker meeting

477
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,900
在南部或者中西部或者太平洋西北部
in the south or the Midwest or the Pacific Northwest

478
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,800
震惊地发现基本上是一种新教服务;
are shocked to find essentially a Protestant service;

479
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,199
里面有牧师、唱诗班、赞美诗、布道，几乎没有沉默,
a pastor, choire, hymns, sermon, virtually no silence,

481
00:22:56,966 --> 00:23:00,333
前面有一个讲道坛，长凳面向前方,
a pulpit up front and pews facing forward,

482
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:02,346
还有一些彩色玻璃窗
and some cases stained glass windows 

483
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:06,166
教堂建筑上的尖塔和奇迹
and steeples on the church buildings and wonder 

484
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,400
“这是从哪儿来的?”。
"Where did this come from?".

485
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:11,733
这一切都可以追溯到复兴时期
It's all traced back to revivals that

486
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:15,200
在南北战争之后蔓延到了南方和中西部:
spread through the South and the Midwest after the Civil War:

489
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,933
卫理公会复兴，卫斯理神学。
Methodist Holiness revivals, Wesleyan theology.

491
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,366
许多贵格会教徒，特别是年轻的贵格会教徒,
And many Quakers, especially young Quakers, 

492
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:27,666
想要打破最安静的时期。
wanting to break out of the Quietest period.

494
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:44,999

00:23:53,466 --> 00:23:57,599
作为其中的一部分，对沉默崇拜的强调较少。
There is less of an emphasis on silent worship as part of it.

499
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,133
我们偶尔也会这么做,
We have done it on occasion,

500
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:02,699
但是我们并不是每个部门都有
but we do not have it in every service

501
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,400
就像一些朋友教堂那样。

福音派运动的一个途径就是

00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,566
影响了我们作为福音派的朋友,
affected us as Evangelical Friends is,

505
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,600
在某些方面，影响音乐。
in some ways, impacting music.

506
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,500
最近几年,
In more recent years,

507
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,966
渴望接触新朋友,
with a desire to reach out to new people,

把人们带入信仰,
to bring people into the faith,

00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,365
音乐是其中很重要的一部分。
music is a huge part of that. 

510
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:32,499
所以现代风格的音乐更具吸引力,
And so more contemporary styles of music is more appealing,

511
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,266
特别是对一些年轻人

00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,099

我一想到女人

站在白宫前就
standing in front of the White House,

657
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:04,099
要求她们的投票权就很触动,
demanding their right to vote,

658
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,366
即使是在战争中。
even in the midst of a war.

659
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,666
这是一个非常现实的风险，女人进监狱。
And it was a very real risk and women went to jail.

660
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,366
但我就不能投票了
But I wouldn't have just been able to vote

661
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,366
如果不是这样的话,
if that weren't the case,

662
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:21,066
如果她不像在监狱里那样绝食抗议
if she didn't do the hunger strikes that she had done in jail and

664
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:23,466
就像她把其他女人拉进来一样
the way that she pulled other women in

665
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:26,999
对于实际可能性有着远大的愿景
and had a big vision for what was actually possible

00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,166
我站在她的肩膀上。
And I stand on her shoulders.

668
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:35,533
PNC 声称是一家绿色银行，
PNC was claiming to be a green bank

669
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:38,699
他们也是一家有贵格会根基的银行。
and they also are a bank with Quaker roots.

670
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,866
很多贵格会机构仍然把钱投在 PNC，
And a lot of Quaker institutions still had their money in PNC 

671
00:32:42,866 --> 00:32:44,966
因为这种历史性的联系。
because of that historic connection.

672
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,566
所以在我们看来

00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:05,766
从山顶移动采煤。
from mountaintop removal coal mining.

682
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:10,199
贵格会组织来到朋友信托基金
Quaker organizations come to Friends Fiduciary

683
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:13,399
作为一个团体，以纳入贵格会的价值观
as a group to incorporate Quaker values

684
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:16,899
对他们的资产进行财务管理。
in the financial stewardship of their assets.

686
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,546
因此，我们管理约350,000,000资产
So we manage about 350,000,000 in assets for 

688
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:25,366
全国各地的教友会，教堂和学校。
Quaker meetings, churches and schools across the country.

689
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,166
因为地球贵格会行动小组
Because Earth Quaker Action Team

690
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,000
主要涉及贵格会教徒,
primarily involves Quakers,

691
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,866
有一种亲和力
there's a certain affinity

692
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:34,733
地球贵格会行动小组和
between Earth Quaker Action Team and

693
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:38,133
朋友受托人，因为我们服务贵格会组织。
Friends Fiduciary because we serve Quaker organizations.

694
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:42,599
朋友信托公司联合提交了一份股东提案
Friends Fiduciary co-filed a shareholder proposal

695
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,866
波士顿公共资产管理公司,
with Boston Common Asset Management,

696
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:46,099
我们的一个合伙人,
one of our partners,

697
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:47,866
要求陪伴
asking for the company

698
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,666
在这个特殊的情况下
in this particular case

699
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:52,799
报告他们的温室气体排放和
to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and

700
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:56,866
一般来说，在他们的融资组合中考虑气候风险。
looking at climate risk in their financing portfolios, generally.

702
00:33:57,133 --> 00:34:01,466
我们做了公民抗命，2013年有了很大的增长,
We did civil disobedience and a big growth came in 2013,

703
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:06,099
我们一天做了15个动作。
when we staged 15 actions on one day.

704
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:11,733
今天的最后一个行动是逮捕7个人。
And the last action of the day was 7 people getting arrested.

706
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:14,533
我们在这里..。
We are here...

707
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,486
我们会战斗。
And we will fight.

708
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:23,933
我们需要每个社区都有一群天使般的麻烦制造者。
We need it every community a group of angelic troublemakers.

710
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:30,799
我们的力量在于我们有能力让事情变得不可行。
Our power is in our ability to make things unworkable.

711
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,533
然后我们继续在地理上成长,
We then continue to grow geographically,

712
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:38,466
2014年12月6日,
and on December 6th of 2014,

713
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:42,729
我们做了31个动作
we were able to do 31 actions 

714
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:45,599
在哥伦比亚特区的13个州。
in 13 states in the District of Columbia.

715
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:47,699
所以我觉得一部分原因是
So I think part of what happened was

716
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,766
他们看到我们不会离开。
they saw we were not going away.

717
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:50,999
我们在成长。
We were growing.

718
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,000
我们变得更加大胆。
we were becoming more bold.

719
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:57,699
我们去拜访行政长官比尔 · 德姆切克的时候,
The time that we visited the CE, Bill Demcheck, at his house,

721
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,099
他出来和我们的人谈了一个小时,
he actually came out and talked to our people for an hour,

723
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,799
这是分配给我的，我们真的产生了影响。
and that was assigned to me that we were really making an impact.

725
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,707
所以花了5年时间，做了很多很多的工作,
So it took 5 years, it took lots and lots of work,

726
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,676
需要很多很多人。
it took lots and lots of people.

727
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,766
我们成功了，他们逃出来了。
And we did it, they got out.

728
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,200
他们非常有战略眼光，就像我说的，考虑周到。
They were very strategic and as I said, thoughtful.

729
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,366
我们利用贵格会崇拜作为我们工作的一部分，
We are using Quaker worship as part of what we do

730
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
这样很安全。
and that there's a lot of safety in that.

731
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:27,499
这里有很多关于社区的经验
There's a lot of experience of community which

732
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:32,133
我认识的每个人都渴望得到，尤其是年轻人。
everyone I know is hungry for and especially young people.

734
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:35,166
我认为年轻人尤其需要社区,
I think especially young people are wanting community,

735
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:37,733
不一定是为了这个
aren't necessarily looking for that

736
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,733
周日早上在教堂,
on Sunday mornings at a church,

737
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,199
而是希望能够在世界上有影响力
but want to be able to act powerfully in the world

738
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,800
并且有精神上的根源。
and have a spiritual rootedness to that.

739
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:56,733
约翰 · 伍尔曼是早期贵格会废奴主义者，
John Woolman was an early Quaker abolitionist who

740
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,423
他写了一本日记，这本日记
wrote a journal, which has been continuously in print 

742
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:04,699
自1775年出版以来一直再版。
since it was published in 1775.

744
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:11,266
这本日记激励了很多人追随自己的良知。
And it's inspired many people to follow their consciences.

746
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,400
我觉得，伍尔曼能够
He has the ability to,

748
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:19,599
设身处地为他人着想,
I think, put himself in other people's shoes,

749
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,884
把自己放在印第安人的位置上
this active imagination to put himself in the shoes of Indians 

751
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:29,700
他们不再生活在他们曾经生活过的土地上。
who are no longer living on the land that they used to live in.

752
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:34,509
他设身处地为奴隶着想,
He puts himself in the shoes of slaves,

753
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:36,966
设身处地为贵格会奴隶主着想。
slaves with Quaker masters.

754
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,450
他设身处地为贵格会的奴隶主考虑
He puts himself in the shoes of Quaker slave owners 

755
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,799
并且意识到他们有要留住奴隶的压力，
and realizes that they have pressures toward holding on to slaves

757
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,799
解放他们的奴隶不是一个简单的决定。
and that just freeing your slaves is not a simple decision.

759
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:52,699
在约翰 · 伍尔曼所在的新泽西西部,
In John Woolman's part of New Jersey, West Jersey,

760
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,066
每20个人中就有一个是奴隶。
one in every 20 people was a slave.

761
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:58,399
让我们想象一下 John Woolman 来拜访
Let's imagine that John Woolman comes to visit

762
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,366
束缚他人的人。
someone who holds others in human bondage.

763
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,333
于是他来了,
And so he arrives,

764
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:06,456
种植园主说,
and the plantation owner says, 

765
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:09,300
“欢迎，我给你拿点喝的”。
"Welcome, let me get you something to drink".

766
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:14,199
所以我拿出了茶和最好的银器,
So I bring out my tea and my finest silver,

768
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,566
然后我说，“你要喝点茶吗?”。
and I say, "Will you have some tea?".

769
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,399
他说，“其实我不喝银器里的东西”。
And he says, "Well, actually I don't drink from silver vessels".

771
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:22,966
“为什么不喝呢?”。
"Well, why would that be?".

772
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:24,799
“你知道银矿在哪里开采吗?”。
"Well, do you know where silver is mined?".

773
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,733
“在加勒比海开采，在巴西开采,
"It's mined in Caribbean, it's mined in Brazil,

774
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:29,766
它不是由自由的劳动力开采的。”。
and it's not mined by free labor".

775
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:34,766
我们谈论奴隶制，它是如何被反对的,
We talk about slavery, how it is opposed to,

776
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,366
所有的宗教原则,
all religious principles,

777
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:39,466
这是怎么回事。
how it is, ...

778
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,799
不仅对奴隶不利,
not just bad for the slaves,

779
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,533
但对奴隶主和他们的孩子不利。
but bad for the slave holders and for their children.

780
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,166
终于在约翰 · 伍尔曼准备离开的时候,
Finally as John Woolman is preparing to leave,

781
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,733
他把手伸进口袋,
he reaches into his pocket,

782
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:51,426
拿出一些硬币说,
pulls out some coins and says, 

783
00:37:51,426 --> 00:37:54,466
“哦，好吧，我知道你没有补偿
"Oh, well, I understand you don't compensate

784
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:56,666
你的仆人们的劳动”
your servants for their labor."

785
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:59,366
”我认为人们应该为他们的所作所为付出代价,
"Well, I think people should be paid for what they've done,

787
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:00,099
特别是对我来说。
especially for me.

788
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,766
所以我希望你把这些钱给你的奴隶。
So I hope you'll give this money to your slaves".

790
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:06,919
我们有两面，我们有灵性上的，稍微神秘的一面，
We have 2 sides, we have the spiritual, slightly mystical side 

791
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:10,705
我们在世俗面都有自己的行动。
and we have our action in the world side.

793
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:15,700
John Woolman 就是这两方面的典型例子,
And John Woolman is a great example of these 2 sides,

795
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:19,799
相互平衡，相互通知
balancing each other and informing each other

796
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:24,700
我们如何体验神圣，我们内心的想法
that what we think inwardly in how we experience the divine

798
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,533
然后影响我们在世界上的行为。
then affects how we act in the world.

800
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:35,612
朋友们开始遭到那些人的反对
Friends began to experience opposition from those 

802
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:38,099
看着贵格会教徒解放他们的奴隶,
who were watching Quakers free their slaves,

803
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,333
这是违法的。
which was against the law.

804
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:44,366
所以朋友们必须想办法绕过法律
And so Friends had to find ways of getting around the laws

806
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:48,259
并最终参与其中
and eventually were very involved 

807
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,266
和地下铁路有关。
with the Underground Railroad.

808
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,600
有一个庞大的网络
There was a large network of

809
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,766
印第安纳州的反奴隶制活动家。
anti-slavery activists in Indiana.

810
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,471
Levi Coffin 很快就下了订单,
Levi Coffin became a quick order, 

811
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:05,733
运动中一个非常重要的齿轮。
a very important cog in the movement.

812
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:10,214
有个赏金猎人来了
There was a bounty hunter who came 

813
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:13,366
在纽波特寻找他的奴隶
looking for his slaves here in Newport

814
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:15,266
在屋外踱步
and was pacing outside the house

815
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:16,366
非常沮丧
and was very frustrated

816
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:17,999
因为他可以遵循
because he could follow the

817
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:21,566
追踪逃亡的奴隶到 Levi Coffin 家,
trail of fugitive slaves to Levi Coffin's house,

819
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:23,799
但后来线索突然断了。
but then the trail suddenly went cold.

820
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,733
他说，这里有一条地下铁路
And he said, "Well, there's an underground railroad here

822
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,066
而这个人，Levi Coffin，就是它的主席。”
and this man, Levi Coffin,  is the president of it."

823
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:37,574
作为回应 Levi Coffin 说,
In response, Levi Coffin said, 

824
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,766
他会接受总统的职位。
he would accept the office of president.

825
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:42,733
他愿意接受任何职位，包括列车长,
And he would accept any office including conductor,

826
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:45,933
地下铁路的工程师或制动员。
engineer, or brakeman in the Underground Railroad.

828
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,440
重要的是服务
The important thing was to  serve 

829
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,800
被压迫的人类的事业,
the cause of oppressed humanity,

830
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,533
照着他主耶稣所吩咐他们的去做。
the way that Jesus his Lord had told them to do.

831
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,599
很多朋友都是废奴主义者,
Many friends were leaders as abolitionists,

833
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,566
但当时他们并不被视为英雄。
but at that time they were not seen as heroes.

834
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,792
在那个时候，他们被视为人
At that time, they were seen as people 

835
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,066
他们违反了常规
who were going against the norm

836
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:35,133
这是对宗教之友协会的挑战
and that was challenging the Religious Society of Friends

838
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,733
伸展，转变，改变。
to stretch and to transform and to change.

839
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,533
贵格会教徒是第一个
Quakers were the first to

840
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,733
整个宗教社会都有发言权
have the religious society as a whole say

841
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:47,133
奴役非洲人后裔是不合适的。
it was not appropriate to enslave people of African descent.

843
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:51,214
但他们在1776年这样做的时候就很清楚了
But they were clear when they did this in 1776 

844
00:40:51,214 --> 00:40:54,266
他们自己也想实行种族隔离。
that they wanted to have segregation themselves.

846
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:57,454
所以贵格会确实推迟了整合
So Quakers did delay integration 

847
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:59,933
大部分贵格会学校。
of the majority of Quaker schools.

848
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:02,525
有几所贵格会学校
There were a few Quaker schools 

849
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:06,966
在20世纪30年代接纳了一些非裔美国人。
that admitted some African Americans in the 1930s.

850
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:12,399
但大多数人直到20世纪50年代之后,
But the majority of them didn't until after the 1950s,

852
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,900
在1954年的决定之后。
after the 1954 decision.

853
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,300
最高法院的布朗诉托皮卡教育局案
The Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education

855
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:22,733
意味着所有的公立学校都被要求废除种族隔离。
meant that all public schools were ordered to desegregate.

857
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:25,148
然而，非裔美国人申请者
Yet African American applicants 

858
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:27,399
许多贵格会学校和学院
to many Quaker schools and colleges

贝亚德 · 拉斯廷出生在一个贵格会教徒家庭。

拉斯廷的和平贵格会信仰也是如此

大规模股市崩盘的那一年。

面对日益增长的失业率和食品供应紧张,

邻居之间应该互相帮助。

00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,666

962
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,500
理查德 · 尼克松是加州贵格会教徒,
Richard Nixon was a California Quaker,

963
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,100
这意味着加州贵格会
and what that means is that California Quakerism

964
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,600
更倾向于福音式的改变
tends to be more evangelically inflected

965
00:47:11,766 --> 00:47:13,299
而不是其他类型的教友派。
than other kinds of Quakerism.

966
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:17,066
所以尼克松从小就不会有无声的崇拜。
So Nixon growing up wouldn't have had silent worship.

967
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:18,866
他就不会有牧师了
He wouldn't have had a minister

968
00:47:18,933 --> 00:47:21,199
所以长大成人后,
and so becoming an adult,

969
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:24,366
尼克松坚信贵格会的传统
Nixon viewed himself firmly in a Quaker tradition

970
00:47:24,366 --> 00:47:25,866
是他母亲留下的。
that came from his mother.

971
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:28,399
但这也是福音派的传统。
But it was also an evangelical tradition.

972
00:47:28,466 --> 00:47:30,266
尼克松和胡佛是朋友。
Nixon and Hoover are friends.

973
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,000
我觉得这其中可能有某种联系
And I do think there's probably a connection

974
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,050
他们都是贵格会教徒
between them both being Quakers

975
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,166
就他们之间的亲密程度而言。
 in terms of their close affinity to each other.

976
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:38,321
所以尼克松算是个门徒
So Nixon is sort of a protégé 

977
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:41,499
共和党的这头老狮子。
of this old lion at the Republican Party.

978

赫伯特 · 胡佛,
Herbert Hoover,

979
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,933
当他成为第一位贵格会会长时,
when he had been the first Quaker president,

980
00:47:44,933 --> 00:47:46,866
去华盛顿开会了。
had gone to Washington meeting.

981
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,566
尼克松不会这么做
Nixon doesn't do that

982
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,733
因为这是一个没有程序的会议
because it's an unprogram meeting

983
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:52,599
这意味着任何人都可以说话。
and that means that anybody can speak.

984
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,100
他们不能让他参加没有程序的会议
They can't have him in an unprogram meeting

985
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,033
因为他马上就要被袭击了
because he's just going to be attacked 

986
00:47:57,033 --> 00:47:58,999
在越南战争期间。
the entire time over the Vietnam War.

987
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:00,899
尼克松决定
Nixon decides that he's going to

988
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,133
举行一系列礼拜仪式
hold a series of worship services

989
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,533
在白宫东面的房间里,
inside the White House in the east room,

991
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:07,689
将邀请一些不同的
going to invite a number of different 

992
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:10,340
宗教领袖来领导他们。
religious leaders in order to lead them.

993
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,566
只有受邀才能参加
It's by invitation only

994
00:48:11,566 --> 00:48:13,799
还有很多收到邀请的人
and a lot of the people who receive an invitation

996
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,000
也碰巧是共和党的捐助者或人
also happen to be Republican donors or people

997
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,300
白宫特别想给人留下深刻印象
that the White House particularly wants to impress

998
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,100
让他们接近总统。
by getting them close to the president.

999
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:23,166
其他人认为他是个伪君子。
Others saw him as a hypocrite.

1000
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:26,866
他们称他为“轰炸贵格会教徒”。
They referred to him as "The Bombing Quaker".

1001
00:48:27,266 --> 00:48:30,399
我觉得那是一个可怕的..。
And I thought that was a terrible...

1002
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:34,266
词语的并列
juxtaposition of words

1003
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:37,866
因为你怎么能把它和贵格会联系起来呢？
because how could you associate that with Quakerism?

1004
00:48:38,366 --> 00:48:41,851
我已经熟悉了贵格会的和平证词,
I had become familiar with the Quaker peace testimony,

1006
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:45,933
这是... 费城的年度意义有它的副本
that it was... Philadelphia yearly meaning had copies of it

1007
00:48:45,933 --> 00:48:48,099
现成的。
that were readily available.

1008
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,066
所以每一天，不管我们在哪里,
So every day, no matter where we were,

1009
00:48:51,066 --> 00:48:54,099
我早上第一件事就是去邮箱
I had to get to a mailbox first thing in the morning

1010
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,166
这样我就能收到邮件了。
so I could get it in the mail.

1011
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,966
我是说，所有这些关于贵格会遗产的讨论,
I mean, all this talk about Quaker heritage,

1012
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:01,733
我想提醒他
and I wanted to remind him that

1013
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:05,099
他的所作所为显然不太像贵格会教徒。
what he was doing was certainly not very Quakerly.

1014
00:49:05,366 --> 00:49:09,679
所以对于抗议者，尼克松显然很不高兴
So in terms of protesters, Nixon is obviously very upset 

1015
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:12,166
因为人们在抗议火腿,
by the fact that people are protesting ham,

1016
00:49:12,266 --> 00:49:15,333
抗议他在越南的行为。

他特别不高兴的是
He's particularly upset by the fact that

1018
00:49:17,366 --> 00:49:20,800
贵格会教徒正在这样做，因此他们的各种言论
Quakers are doing so and so their various remarks

1020
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,133
尼克松对他的工作人员和其他人
Nixon makes to his staff and to others

1021
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:26,133
这表明尼克松并不把他们当作真正的贵格会教徒。
that indicate Nixon doesn't see them as real Quakers.

1022
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:27,999
例如，尼克松认为,
Nixon makes the argument, for instance,

1023
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,500
贵格会教徒
that people who are Quakers

1024
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,100
在白宫外抗议
protesting outside the White House

1025
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,036
一定都是最近才加入贵格会的

1026
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:35,766
为了躲避征兵。
in order to, like, dodge the draft.

1027
00:49:41,933 --> 00:49:45,733
贵格会有一段非常光荣的历史
There is an very honored history within Quakerism

1028
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,699
参与，甚至创造，产生,

设计非暴力直接行动运动
designing non-violent direct action campaigns

1031
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,533
让广大人民群众参与进来
that enable masses of people to participate

1032
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,800
尽管有反对意见，还是要做点什么。
and get something done despite the opposition.

1034
00:50:00,466 --> 00:50:03,466
“凤凰号游艇”载有自主定制的施舍船
The "Yacht Phoenix" has self-ordained mercy ship manned

1036
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:06,399
由7名坚定的美国和平主义者组成。
by a crew of 7 determined American pacifists.

1037
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,266
它的使命？

1038
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:08,899
把医疗用品带到
To bring medical supplies to the 

1039
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:12,300
尽管红十字会警告北越海防港
North Vietnamese port of Hai Phong despite Red Cross warnings

1041
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,100
而且没有国务院的许可。
and without State Department clearance.

1042
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:18,199
我觉得我别无选择，只能献出自己,
I felt like I had no choice but to offer myself,

1043
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:21,354
因为我被精神控制了。
because I was compelled by the spirit. 

1044
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:25,466
我认为一个关键的决定
I think a key decision

1046
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,933
朋友们需要做的就是
that friends need to make is whether

1047
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,286
注意观察我们的人
to pay attention to the people who look us over 

1048
00:50:33,286 --> 00:50:35,999
包括年轻人,
and that would include young people,

1050
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,766
因为这是一个精神探索的时代。
because this is a time of spiritual searching.

1051
00:50:39,366 --> 00:50:42,806
贵格会学校有什么特别之处,
So what is special about a Quaker school, 

1052
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:46,842
而不是一个非贵格会学校或公立学校？
as opposed to a non-Quaker school  or a public school?

1053
00:50:46,842 --> 00:50:48,566
我们在这里有什么不同吗？
What do we do differently here?

1054
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,266
- 巷子-我们相信香料。
- Alley.  - We believe in spices.

1055
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,366
香料，是的，香料。
The spices, yes. the spices.

1056
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,652
香料是什么？
So what are the spices?

1057
00:50:56,652 --> 00:50:58,366
佛罗伦萨。
Florence.

1058
00:50:58,566 --> 00:51:01,199
S 代表简单。
The 'S' stands for simplicity.

1059

- P 代表和平-和平。
- 'P' stands for peace.   - Peace.

1062
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,610
“ I”有时候有点难，比阿特丽斯？
The 'I' is sometimes a little tough, Beatrice?

1063
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,766
我认为它代表正直。
I think it stands for integrity.

1064
00:51:17,766 --> 00:51:20,133
正直是什么意思？
What does integrity mean?

1065
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:21,566
这个问题很难回答
That's a really tough question

1066
00:51:21,566 --> 00:51:23,566
因为这是个又大又硬的词。
because it's a nice big, tough word.

1068
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,550
阿兰娜，你..。

即使没人注意，你也在做正确的事。

真是个好答案。
That is a wonderful answer.

1071

当你打开对话

1072
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,099
让学生真正解决问题
and you allow students to really grapple with issues

1074
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,966
用一种有意义和宽容的方式来谈论它,
and really talk about it in a way that is meaningful and tolerant,

1076
00:51:41,133 --> 00:51:44,266
他们就会觉得自己和这件事有利害关系。
then they feel like they have a stake in the matter.

1078
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:48,100
贵格会的未来可能取决于新型的外联活动。
The future of Quakerism may rest on new kinds of outreach.

1080
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:50,199
我们生活在互联网时代,
We live in the age of the internet,

1081
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:53,699
所以贵格会教徒以一种全新的方式结合在一起
so Quakers are knit together in a really new way

1082
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,633
因为我们是贵格会教徒

1083

从17世纪开始。
over the years from the 17th century.

我们已经成为福音派的贵格会教徒
We've become evangelical Quakers 

1085
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,900
自由派教友会和保守派教友会。
and liberal Quakers and conservative Quakers.

1087
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,466
在过去的几个世纪里,
And mostly in the past couple of centuries,

1088
00:52:06,466 --> 00:52:09,099
我们根本没有在这些分支之间进行交流。
we haven't interacted between those branches at all.

1089
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,366
但现在我们上网了,
But now that we're on the internet,

1090
00:52:10,366 --> 00:52:12,533
也许会有什么激动人心的事情发生。
there might be something exciting that's about to happen.

1092
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:14,899
也许会有贵格会的复兴
And there might be a revival of Quakerism

1093

接下来的20年里。

00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,300
大多数贵格会教徒认为沉默是一种综合体验
Most Quakers view the combined experience of silence

1100
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,333
与上帝之光交流
and communion with God's light

1101
00:52:51,366 --> 00:52:53,333
成为信仰的核心。
to be at the heart of the faith.

1102
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,733
既有早期的朋友，也有现代的贵格会教徒

詹姆斯 · 提利尔，贵格会艺术家,
James Tyrell, the Quaker artist,

1105
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,166
色彩受光的影响。
experiments and plays with color as its affected by light.

1107
00:53:09,733 --> 00:53:13,099
有些朋友将其视为神圣的光辉。
Some Friends experience it as divine radiance.

1108
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,066
我参加了一个会议室，栗子山,
I attend this meeting house, Chestnut Hill,

1109
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,166
我喜欢冥想的宁静空间
and I love the meditative peaceful space

1111
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,733
只是躺下投降。
of just laying down and surrendering.

1112
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:28,599
我喜欢暴露在天空中的元素,
I love the exposure to the elements in the sky,

1114
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,966
还有风和云
and the wind and the clouds

1115
00:53:29,966 --> 00:53:32,099
还有那些你无法控制的事情
and the things that you can't control

1116
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,900
或者比我们自己更伟大的东西
or that are greater than ourselves

1117
00:53:35,066 --> 00:53:39,600
它被屋顶的这个长方形框住了。
and that's framed by this rectangle in the roof.

1119
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,930
我们所做的一切都是精神上的。
All of what we're doing is spiritual.

1120
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,933
这是关于我们每个人心中的上帝。
It is about that of God in each of us.

1121
00:54:14,366 --> 00:54:16,733
而是我们对彼此的尊重。
It's about the respect we have for each other.

1122
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:20,499
而是我们每个人肩负的责任。
It's about the responsibility we each carry.

1123
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,966
所以我很高兴能见到这些人,
And so it's been so exciting to me to see people,

1124
00:54:24,466 --> 00:54:26,799
无论他们最终是否成为贵格会教徒,
whether they become ultimately Quaker or not,

1125
00:54:27,566 --> 00:54:32,768
发现安静地坐在一群人中意味着什么？
finding what does it mean to sit in a gathered group in silence?

1126
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:36,905
从沉默中说出来意味着什么,
What does it mean to speak coming out of that silence,

1127
00:54:36,955 --> 00:54:40,199
说出那么深刻的事实吗？
to speak that deep, capital T, truth?

1129
00:54:40,566 --> 00:54:43,466
所以我看到这些，像，人开花
And so I've seen these, like, people blossoming

1130
00:54:43,566 --> 00:54:46,599
因为这是一种表达“是的，我不需要
because it's a way of saying, "Yes, I don't have to have

1131
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,599
我的信仰在这里，我的行动主义在这里”。
my faith over here and my activism over here".
