1
00:00:00,066 --> 00:00:01,699
PNC has a choice to make:

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:03,466
invest in the future.

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,400
And that's in wind energy

4
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:08,533
and renewable energies in alternative economies.

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:10,533
I've been to countless

6
00:00:10,700 --> 00:00:14,533
demonstrations and marches and protests and rallys in

7
00:00:14,533 --> 00:00:19,000
various places and in my early days mostly with my dad.

9
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:21,400
What is that meant for me?

10
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:24,100
I think it means it's a place I feel really comfortable.

11
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,866
It's a place I feel pretty at home

12
00:00:26,866 --> 00:00:30,166
and it's part of my belief of what democracy is about.

13
00:00:30,366 --> 00:00:33,066
It's part of my belief of what Quakerism is about.

14
00:00:33,733 --> 00:00:35,766
My dad has tremendous integrity.

15
00:00:36,066 --> 00:00:38,466
He practices what he preaches

16
00:00:38,566 --> 00:00:40,533
and he's willing to put it on the line.

17
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,533
Who are these quakers?

18
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:51,766
Is it that guy on the Quaker box?

19
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:53,966
Do you still wear the big hats

20
00:00:53,966 --> 00:00:55,933
and do you have the big, burly beards?

21
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:58,466
Are you like the Amish?

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:00:59,933
Do you still ride in buggies?

23
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:08,066
How are modern quakers different from long ago?

25
00:01:13,533 --> 00:01:16,866
Some of my students really know about equality and integrity

27
00:01:16,866 --> 00:01:19,066
and some of the testimonies like peace testimony,

29
00:01:19,066 --> 00:01:21,366
that is fundamental to Quakers today.

30
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,133
How has the past informed the present

31
00:01:24,133 --> 00:01:26,499
and how will the president inform the future?

32
00:01:34,533 --> 00:01:37,699
The Quaker on the cereal box is actually a Presbyterian

33
00:01:38,166 --> 00:01:41,599
oatmeal company who decided to use a Quaker image

34
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,600
because it's associated with reliability and quality.

35
00:01:44,666 --> 00:01:46,899
This is in the late 19th century,

36
00:01:46,966 --> 00:01:50,899
by which time Quakers have become very integrated in society,

38
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:53,000
have become very successful at business.

39
00:01:53,266 --> 00:01:56,766
And so by that point, the image of a Quaker would convey

40
00:01:57,366 --> 00:01:59,899
quality, reliability, integrity.

41
00:02:00,466 --> 00:02:03,366
There's an advice from George fox stated 1670

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:05,733
about not making an undue profit,

43
00:02:06,366 --> 00:02:08,799
but they're being a fair price for something.

44
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:12,666
And so quakers would sell things at a fixed price,

45
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:14,733
not haggar when they were buying things.

46
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,666
And this led to a great respect amongst the wider population

48
00:02:18,666 --> 00:02:20,733
for Quaker integrity and honesty.

49
00:02:20,966 --> 00:02:24,466
And people started to trust quakers with their money and say,

51
00:02:24,466 --> 00:02:25,566
"Well, will you look after this?",

52
00:02:25,566 --> 00:02:27,399
because they knew they would get it back.

53
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:29,066
And from that, you get

54
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,533
Quakers being involved in the sort of

55
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,166
nascent banking industry.

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:35,600
In 1915,

57
00:02:35,733 --> 00:02:39,966
Friends actually tried to get a law through Congress

58
00:02:40,133 --> 00:02:44,733
which would have made it illegal to use the name

60
00:02:44,733 --> 00:02:48,966
of a religious denomination for commercial purposes.

61
00:02:51,866 --> 00:02:53,999
But unfortunately for Friends,

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,733
Quaker Oats had enough lobbying power to kill the bill.

63
00:02:58,100 --> 00:03:01,900
And so Quaker continued to be a

64
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,800
rather powerful advertising symbol.

66
00:03:07,333 --> 00:03:09,699
So I would guess since the late 19th century,

67
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:13,566
they've made billions on billions of dollars.

70
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:41,866
For nearly 400 years,

71
00:03:41,866 --> 00:03:44,866
Quakers have been led by their basic testimonies:

72
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:52,933
simplicity, peace, equality, integrity, stewardship of the earth.

76
00:03:56,700 --> 00:04:00,166
Inward looking, they are directed by the mystical belief

77
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,900
that there is that of God in every person.

78
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:07,099
They also look outward, seeking to change the world.

79
00:04:11,666 --> 00:04:13,566
All quakers are not the same.

80
00:04:14,366 --> 00:04:17,533
There are silent unprogrammed Quaker meetings,

81
00:04:17,566 --> 00:04:23,366
but also Evangelical Quakered churches with pastors and choirs.

84
00:04:25,266 --> 00:04:27,666
Quakers are found in the Americas,

85
00:04:27,966 --> 00:04:32,799
Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the Pacific.

87
00:04:33,066 --> 00:04:35,775
But today more than half of the religious 

88
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,566
Society of Friends live in Africa.

90
00:04:39,133 --> 00:04:42,599
This remarkable growth began in 1902

91
00:04:42,966 --> 00:04:47,500
when Evangelical Quaker missionaries from Ohio travel to Kenya.

93
00:04:47,866 --> 00:04:50,299
Despite these different forms of worship,

94
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:53,000
it is their common testimony to peace

95
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,666
that unites Quakers throughout the world.

96
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:59,066
I went to see a movie about mountaintop removal

97
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,899
coal mining and there was an interview with a woman

98
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:04,566
talking about when she puts her child in a bathtub,

99
00:05:04,566 --> 00:05:07,099
she knows that there's arsenic in that water.

100
00:05:07,566 --> 00:05:08,666
And I'm thinking,

101
00:05:08,733 --> 00:05:11,299
"Let's do a nonviolent direct action campaign".

102
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,666
This is something that's in Quaker DNA.

102
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:15,314
That segregation be ended...

103
00:05:15,466 --> 00:05:16,866
We've done it before.

104
00:05:17,366 --> 00:05:18,733
We can do it again.

105
00:05:18,733 --> 00:05:20,999
It took a proud daughter of New Jersey, Alice Paul,

106
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,166
years of organizing marches

107
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:25,499
and hunger strikes and protests

109
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:28,466
and drafting hundreds of pieces of legislation

110
00:05:28,466 --> 00:05:30,133
and writing letters and giving speeches

111
00:05:30,133 --> 00:05:31,866
and working with congressional leaders

112
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:37,387
before she and other suffragists finally 

114
00:05:37,387 --> 00:05:39,700
helped win women the right to vote.

115
00:05:40,133 --> 00:05:41,474
If you were to put together 

116
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:44,666
a kind of hall of fame of American activists,

117
00:05:44,866 --> 00:05:46,999
whether it be the peace movement,

119
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:50,133
whether it be women's suffrage or abolitionism,

120
00:05:50,133 --> 00:05:52,599
it really is striking when you look at those names,

121
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:55,266
how many of them either were themselves Quakers

122
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,866
or who were influenced by Quaker principles.

123
00:06:05,966 --> 00:06:07,266
I'm not sure if Quakers would have

124
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,066
described themselves as revolutionaries

125
00:06:09,066 --> 00:06:11,338
but they're certainly trying to 

126
00:06:11,338 --> 00:06:13,533
establish the kingdom of God on earth.

127
00:06:13,533 --> 00:06:16,899
They believe that heaven will be established on earth.

128
00:06:17,133 --> 00:06:20,566
It's a spiritual warfare, what they call the Lamb's War,

129
00:06:20,666 --> 00:06:22,599
a reference to the book of Revelation.

130
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,304
George Fox came into this group 

131
00:06:27,304 --> 00:06:30,500
and was seen as a potential leader and a prophetic voice.

133
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:31,499
From what we can gather,

134
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,133
he was very charismatic.

135
00:06:33,533 --> 00:06:34,766
He was a tall,

136
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,266
very powerfully-built man,

137
00:06:36,266 --> 00:06:39,099
and I think people were prepared to listen to him.

138
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:40,733
And he won them over.

139
00:06:41,166 --> 00:06:43,699
He convinced many people quite quickly.

140
00:06:43,866 --> 00:06:48,199
In 1652, George fox comes here to pendle hill and

141
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:49,933
says he's moved by the lord

142
00:06:49,933 --> 00:06:52,766
and he has a vision of a great people to be gathered.

143
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:55,030
We could really date that vision 

144
00:06:55,030 --> 00:06:56,900
as the beginning of quakerism,

145
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,966
as a church, as a movement.

146
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,633
And what he discovers is that 

147
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:04,133
he can have a direct relationship with God.

148
00:07:04,266 --> 00:07:06,799
And this is really foundational for Quakerism

149
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,666
and becomes the fundamental belief,

150
00:07:08,666 --> 00:07:11,733
that they don't need a minister or a book

152
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,200
to tell them what is of God.

153
00:07:14,766 --> 00:07:18,000
Everybody is to be a minister, essentially,

155
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:22,200
It's a very open and universal message

156
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:26,166
that something new is happening for the people of England.

158
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,300
Quakers of course are part of the historic peace church movement

160
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,716
with Mennonites and Brethren,

161
00:07:31,716 --> 00:07:34,866
they've been part of the civil rights movement,

163
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,166
they've been followers of Gandhi and civil disobedience at times.

165
00:07:40,733 --> 00:07:44,364
And they've been key in the role of petition and lobby 

167
00:07:44,364 --> 00:07:48,900
to try and change government minds over 3 and 1/2 centuries

168
00:07:50,666 --> 00:07:52,733
The basic principles of Quakerism  

169
00:07:52,733 --> 00:07:56,799
did not initially include pacifism or the peace testimony

170
00:07:56,866 --> 00:07:59,799
but soon it became one of the core beliefs

171
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:02,600
that was not negotiable to the early Quakers.

172
00:08:05,766 --> 00:08:07,459
I am generally suspected to be 

173
00:08:07,459 --> 00:08:09,800
a common disturber of the nation's peace,

174
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:12,533
"an enemy to the king and that I,

175
00:08:12,733 --> 00:08:15,533
with others endeavor to raise insurrections

176
00:08:15,533 --> 00:08:17,566
to embroil the nation in blood",

177
00:08:17,966 --> 00:08:20,166
"All of which is utterly false,

178
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,099
and I do in every part deny it,

179
00:08:23,866 --> 00:08:26,366
for my weapons are spiritual,

180
00:08:26,666 --> 00:08:30,566
which take away the occasion of war and lead into peace".

181
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,366
He was brought before the court for his preaching in 1650.

183
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:41,300
Even then, he is seen as a dangerous preacher.

184
00:08:41,366 --> 00:08:43,733
And so the judge says to him,

185
00:08:43,733 --> 00:08:45,533
"Do you not quake before God?".

186
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,933
And George Fox says,

187
00:08:46,933 --> 00:08:48,466
"Yes, you should as well".

188
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:52,799
And it was seen as a derogatory named to be called a Quaker,

189
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:55,369
and it was really the early 20th century 

190
00:08:55,369 --> 00:08:56,966
before Quaker started to think,

191
00:08:56,966 --> 00:08:58,766
"All right, well, we'll own it".

192
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,700
You know, "We'll be Guakers".

193
00:09:00,966 --> 00:09:02,599
And so this is where this...

194
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,166
and we are all happily Quakers now,

195
00:09:05,166 --> 00:09:07,800
but I dare say if you've gone back to the 18th century,

197
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:10,333
they would most certainly not have been happy about being quakers.

199
00:09:10,400 --> 00:09:12,700
They were the Religious Society of Friends.

200
00:09:14,333 --> 00:09:17,666
Fox saw women as equal to men in the eyes of God.

201
00:09:18,066 --> 00:09:20,399
Women, like men, could be ministers,

202
00:09:20,666 --> 00:09:22,799
speaking publicly for their faith.

203
00:09:24,866 --> 00:09:26,166
That's been a huge gift to me

204
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,133
is how powerful women are in Quakerism,

205
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:32,599
and that the power of women has not...

207
00:09:32,866 --> 00:09:35,399
at least in my experience been held down,

208
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,499
but been really welcomed.

209
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,200
So learning what it means to be a Quaker feminist...

210
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:44,100
but I had some great teachers.

211
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,566
Margaret Fell is one of the key early Quaker leaders

212
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,533
and a symbol

213
00:09:49,566 --> 00:09:52,399
of women's leadership in the early Quaker movement.

214
00:09:52,666 --> 00:09:55,466
She writes letters and tracts

215
00:09:55,733 --> 00:09:58,799
theologically sophisticated and very compelling.

216
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,400
She wrote one called "Women's speaking justified",

217
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,600
arguing for the right of women to preach.

218
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:06,566
She provided a safe haven

219
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,500
at her home at Swarthmore hall,

220
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:13,299
financial support and assistance to George fox and others.

222
00:10:13,666 --> 00:10:17,566
My feeling is that if Margaret Fell had not stepped forward

224
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:21,733
with the kinds of material support that she provided,

225
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,600
that it's unlikely that George Fox could have succeeded.

226
00:10:26,666 --> 00:10:28,166
She herself is put into jail.

227
00:10:28,166 --> 00:10:30,933
She has a land stripped away from her at one point.

228
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:31,466
And she says,

229
00:10:31,466 --> 00:10:33,733
"Although I'm no longer under the king's protection,

230
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,266
I know I'm under God's".

231
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:38,266
Generally, I think the women preachers did have a tougher time,

233
00:10:38,266 --> 00:10:41,766
because, of course, women preaching themselves was unusual.

235
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:45,700
The trembling and shaking that came with Quakerism

236
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:49,266
was seen to be some kind of dangerous hysteria.

237
00:10:49,866 --> 00:10:54,199
One of the punishments which some Quakers

238
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:56,100
would have been subjected to...

239
00:10:56,166 --> 00:10:59,566
and in particular, Quaker women would be the scold's bridle.

241
00:11:00,266 --> 00:11:03,599
And essentially, it is a cage

242
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:07,399
that fits over the person's head.

243
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:13,166
With a metal bar inside that goes over the tongue.

244
00:11:13,666 --> 00:11:15,866
They would be taken to the marketplace

245
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,066
as the other person led them around.

246
00:11:18,066 --> 00:11:21,966
They were pulling on the chain which made the cage move.

247
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:25,000
And as it moved, the metal bar moved inside the mouth,

248
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,966
which meant that teeth were broken,

249
00:11:27,166 --> 00:11:31,466
jaws were occasionally broken, absolute agony.

250
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,800
The followers of Quakerism, hundreds of them,

251
00:11:34,900 --> 00:11:38,200
would be held in the common room in Lancaster Prison.

252
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,933
They would speak to each other.

253
00:11:39,933 --> 00:11:44,366
They would create among themselves...

256
00:11:44,933 --> 00:11:50,333
a very strong solidarity of resistance to the government.

258
00:11:52,566 --> 00:11:56,466
Something that I think has been

260
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,100
perpetrated through the centuries in Quakerism,

261
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,387
and that goes back to the common room 

262
00:12:02,387 --> 00:12:05,333
at Lancaster prison in the late 1600s.

265
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:09,466
Probably about 11,000 a put in prison during this time

266
00:12:09,666 --> 00:12:13,933
and over 400 die in prison in those 3 decades.

267
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,366
The strong solidarity they developed

268
00:12:18,366 --> 00:12:20,566
as a result of this carried them

270
00:12:20,766 --> 00:12:25,366
onward into America with even more religious resolve.

271
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:29,933
Their experience in English prisons filthy,

272
00:12:29,933 --> 00:12:31,666
crowded and dangerous...

273
00:12:31,866 --> 00:12:35,133
led them to join in the recreation of prison reform,

274
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,300
first in Philadelphia's, Walnut Street Jail

275
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:42,266
and then in the city's massive Eastern State Penitentiary.

277
00:12:50,166 --> 00:12:52,866
They introduced the concept of single prisoner

278
00:12:52,866 --> 00:12:55,566
confinement with a light in each cell

279
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,699
from a small opening in this ceiling,

280
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:02,133
suggesting the prisoner could benefit from exposure to the Divine.

282
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,966
The only book in their cell was a bible,

283
00:13:06,133 --> 00:13:10,966
to pray for forgiveness, reconcile their past and start anew.

285
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,527
This solution may have worked for Quakers, 

286
00:13:15,527 --> 00:13:18,496
but many others who found themselves isolated 

287
00:13:18,496 --> 00:13:22,733
for weeks, months and years saw it as mental torture.

289
00:13:23,266 --> 00:13:26,499
This was a whopper of an unintended consequence.

290
00:13:27,133 --> 00:13:30,766
Yet there are still now tens of thousands of men and women

292
00:13:30,766 --> 00:13:34,999
shut away in solitary confinement in American prisons.

293
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:37,400
Most people in the United States would probably

294
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:41,699
associate the concentration of Quakers with the Delaware Valley.

296
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,900
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

297
00:13:44,166 --> 00:13:47,333
But there were large numbers of Quakers 

299
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:49,099
in the Carolinas already in the 1660s.

300
00:13:49,866 --> 00:13:56,099
They were escaping the persecutions of Qakers in New England.

302
00:13:56,766 --> 00:13:59,366
Puritans weren't big fans of Quakers.

303
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,800
Quakers didn't pay their church tithes.

304
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:05,366
They didn't support the ordain clergy.

305
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,666
They wouldn't serve in the militia because of their testimonies.

307
00:14:09,733 --> 00:14:12,133
So they weren't much welcome in New England.

308
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:16,533
And in fact, in 1660, four quakers were hanged

309
00:14:16,733 --> 00:14:19,199
on Boston Common simply for being Quaker.

310
00:14:19,933 --> 00:14:21,533
Not the quakers bear grudges,

311
00:14:21,533 --> 00:14:22,627
but we can still name them: 

312
00:14:22,627 --> 00:14:24,799
Mary Dyer, William Robinson,

313
00:14:25,066 --> 00:14:27,466
William Leddra and Marmaduke Stephenson.

314
00:14:32,366 --> 00:14:36,207
Some early colonies were opened to accepting other faiths,

315
00:14:36,207 --> 00:14:38,366
like Rhode Island in New England,

316
00:14:38,900 --> 00:14:42,533
in the South, North Carolina was also more welcoming.

317
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,933
And then there was Pennsylvania,

318
00:14:45,066 --> 00:14:48,533
founded by William Penn in 1681.

319
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:55,060
Penn is very unlike any of the other early Friends.

320
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,266
He's from a well-to-do background.

321
00:14:57,266 --> 00:15:02,000
His father is an admiral and moving in aristocratic circles.

323
00:15:03,966 --> 00:15:06,166
He is educated at Oxford,

324
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,266
but whilst his at Oxford, 

325
00:15:08,266 --> 00:15:11,399
starts to pick up some radical religious ideas.

326
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,600
And his father's not very happy about this,

327
00:15:13,866 --> 00:15:15,666
takes him out of Oxford.

328
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,400
It was against the law

329
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,733
to publicly preach and defend quakerism in England.

330
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,000
Penn was sent to prison 4 times.

331
00:15:24,866 --> 00:15:28,133
His most famous book, "No cross, no crown",

332
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,366
in which he admonishes the king,

333
00:15:30,566 --> 00:15:32,899
was written in 1668

334
00:15:32,900 --> 00:15:35,866
while serving a sentence in the Tower of London.

335
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:42,066
As a repayment of a debt to his father, Admiral Penn,

336
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:45,843
Charles II grants the land that now we know 

338
00:15:45,843 --> 00:15:48,700
as Pennsylvania to William Penn,

339
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:52,900
and he becomes the proprietor of Pennsylvania.

340
00:15:55,766 --> 00:15:59,924
Why would a king grant this much territory

342
00:15:59,924 --> 00:16:03,000
to one person at this particular time?

343
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,300
And one of the theories is that

344
00:16:05,533 --> 00:16:07,065
they would have been very happy 

345
00:16:07,065 --> 00:16:09,367
if these troublesome Quakers would have packed up 

346
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:11,300
and left England.

347
00:16:12,133 --> 00:16:13,366
By some accounts,

348
00:16:13,566 --> 00:16:15,506
William Penn becomes, in 1681, 

349
00:16:15,506 --> 00:16:18,666
the largest private landowner in the world.

350
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,966
Penn sets up what we would call the Holy Experiment,

351
00:16:23,266 --> 00:16:28,133
a desire to have a state that's run on Godly principles,

352
00:16:28,133 --> 00:16:30,866
where religious toleration is guaranteed.

353
00:16:33,566 --> 00:16:34,933
Penn's frame of government

354
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:37,266
granted significant religious freedom,

355
00:16:37,366 --> 00:16:40,533
though not with a guarantee of civil liberties for all.

356
00:16:41,133 --> 00:16:42,799
Voting and office-holding

357
00:16:42,866 --> 00:16:45,399
were restricted to white male Christians.

358
00:16:46,266 --> 00:16:48,666
Penn extended his belief in toleration

359
00:16:48,666 --> 00:16:50,699
to relations with the Indians.

360
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:52,533
He met with tribal leaders,

361
00:16:52,566 --> 00:16:56,333
respected the rights of Native Americans to live on the land,

363
00:16:56,466 --> 00:16:59,099
and paid for the land purchased from them.

364
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:05,366
Sadly, that lofty vision was not to be fulfilled.

365
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,700
Quakers found themselves unable

366
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:10,400
to control others who came to Pennsylvania,

367
00:17:10,466 --> 00:17:14,133
hungry for land and finally withdrew all together

369
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,699
from trying to enforce those early treaties.

370
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:19,666
Pennsylvania was not the peaceable kingdom

371
00:17:19,666 --> 00:17:21,806
and Penn himself was quite disappointed 

372
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:24,442
in the way the place developed.

372
00:17:24,442 --> 00:17:25,892
It developed more or less like

373
00:17:25,900 --> 00:17:29,515
lots of other political communities with factions and disputes 

374
00:17:29,515 --> 00:17:32,566
and arguments over money and land and all the rest.

376
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,916
William Penn was a man of his time and owned about 9 slaves.

377
00:17:37,166 --> 00:17:41,800
We only know that he gave at least one named Yaffe  his freedom.

379
00:17:44,566 --> 00:17:46,599
30 years before Penn's death,

380
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:50,666
some Quakers had already begun speaking out against slavery.

381
00:17:51,938 --> 00:17:53,938
- Wanna try?	- Sure.

382
00:17:53,933 --> 00:17:59,099
Almost at the outset quakers saw slaves as sharing the inner light.

384
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,100
Remarkably, William Penn spent only

385
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,499
4 years in his beloved Pennsylvania.

386
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,400
Legal conflicts over land rights in America and Ireland

387
00:18:13,866 --> 00:18:16,399
brought him back to England in 1702.

388
00:18:16,866 --> 00:18:21,566
He died in extreme debt in 1718 at the age of 73.

390
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:26,200
but his influence on america's future path of tolerance

391
00:18:26,333 --> 00:18:29,733
equality and freedom was immeasurable.

392
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,933
Even as quakers gained power, there was a reaction:

393
00:18:35,133 --> 00:18:36,699
the Quietest period,

394
00:18:36,733 --> 00:18:40,933
driven by Quakers who now became more exclusive and restrictive.

396
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:45,566
Most historians look at the beginning of the Quietest period

398
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,966
coming around at late 1600s,

400
00:18:48,966 --> 00:18:52,866
early 1700s and lasting into the middle of the 1800s,

402
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,899
about 150 year period.

403
00:18:55,333 --> 00:18:58,999
And marrying out or marrying a non-Quaker was not allowed.

405
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:00,673
 It was a disown-able offense,

406
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:03,499
or it was something that if you did,

407
00:19:03,733 --> 00:19:06,699
then you could be dropped from your membership.

408
00:19:06,866 --> 00:19:10,733
Dolley Payne,  who's more properly known as Dolly Madison,

409
00:19:10,733 --> 00:19:15,533
was born into a Quaker family in New Garden, North Carolina.

411
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:17,466
Her first husband was a Quaker,

412
00:19:17,466 --> 00:19:21,000
and then her husband died of the yellow fever.

414
00:19:21,566 --> 00:19:23,933
And when she remarried,

415
00:19:23,933 --> 00:19:27,166
she married a non-Quaker, James Madison,

416
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:30,166
and she was dropped from membership.

417
00:19:30,266 --> 00:19:33,866
But she did maintain an affection

419
00:19:33,866 --> 00:19:35,499
for the Society of Friends throughout her life.

420
00:19:35,500 --> 00:19:38,300
Although she didn't dress overly Quakerly,

421
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,166
if you take a look at her portraits.

422
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:42,399
She was quite fashionable

423
00:19:42,466 --> 00:19:45,899
and was known as quite a hostess in the White House.

424
00:19:46,733 --> 00:19:49,666
Just as the Quietest supposed marrying out,

425
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,600
their strict beliefs even banned art, music and fiction.

426
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:58,566
The aversion to art, to music is not new.

427
00:19:58,933 --> 00:20:02,733
Early Quakers were very very firm on this.

428
00:20:02,733 --> 00:20:05,299
It took many centuries before

429
00:20:06,166 --> 00:20:10,533
Friends started to warm up even to novels.

430
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:13,266
The great abolitionist Lucretia Mott

431
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,266
would not read "Uncle Tom's cabin" even though

432
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:19,066
she admired the work of the author,

433
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:22,466
because it was a novel and it was not true.

434
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,100
So we are evolving from that.

435
00:20:36,766 --> 00:20:38,099
Here in this silence,

436
00:20:38,333 --> 00:20:41,733
people wait for a leading from the Divine to speak.

437
00:20:42,366 --> 00:20:43,866
There is no pastor.

438
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:48,566
Everyone is a minister and shares that responsibility.

440
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:00,399
Come into my Father's house.

442
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,166
Come into God's house.

443
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:06,699
And he welcomed people of all types:

445
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,466
imperfect people, sinners...

447
00:21:11,466 --> 00:21:13,933
He welcomed all into God's house.

448
00:21:19,366 --> 00:21:20,366
I am a teacher

449
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:25,133
and I often teach my students that part of respect

450
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:27,733
is learning to trust one another

452
00:21:28,766 --> 00:21:32,133
and that you should be able to trust your neighbor.

453
00:21:35,500 --> 00:21:38,533
Trust takes a long time to build

454
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:43,733
and it seems like it's all too easy to destroy.

455
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,133
We have a certain segment of our population

456
00:21:47,133 --> 00:21:49,866
that has discovered fear as a commodity

457
00:21:50,133 --> 00:21:54,333
which is marketed regularly to the general public.

459
00:21:55,766 --> 00:22:00,733
I'm Amy Kelly from the committee on worship and ministry.

461
00:22:00,866 --> 00:22:04,533
And I think we probably have some visitors here today

462
00:22:04,533 --> 00:22:06,657
who'd like to tell us who you are 

463
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:08,666
and where you're from so we can greet you.

464
00:22:09,566 --> 00:22:11,600
Hi, friends, my name is Ali Mutar.

466
00:22:11,733 --> 00:22:14,699
My meeting is an Old Chatham Friends meeting in New York.

468
00:22:14,866 --> 00:22:17,933
But I'm starting my PhD here at Princeton,

469
00:22:17,933 --> 00:22:21,799
so I'll be here for 5~7 years.

470
00:22:21,407 --> 00:22:22,540
It's fine.

471
00:22:22,666 --> 00:22:24,475
I'm quite excited to...

472
00:22:24,666 --> 00:22:26,133
We might claim you for a while.

473
00:22:26,133 --> 00:22:28,079
Yeah, yeah, exactly, exactly.

474
00:22:30,966 --> 00:22:35,199
Many people who think they've got Quakerism figured out...

475
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:41,866
and then visit a typical Quaker meeting

477
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,900
in the south or the Midwest or the Pacific Northwest

478
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:49,800
are shocked to find essentially a Protestant service;

479
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:56,199
a pastor, choire, hymns, sermon, virtually no silence,

481
00:22:56,966 --> 00:23:00,333
a pulpit up front and pews facing forward,

482
00:23:00,366 --> 00:23:02,346
and some cases stained glass windows 

483
00:23:02,366 --> 00:23:06,166
and steeples on the church buildings and wonder 

484
00:23:06,166 --> 00:23:08,400
"Where did this come from?".

485
00:23:08,766 --> 00:23:11,733
It's all traced back to revivals that

486
00:23:11,733 --> 00:23:15,200
spread through the South and the Midwest after the Civil War:

489
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:19,933
Methodist Holiness revivals, Wesleyan theology.

491
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,366
And many Quakers, especially young Quakers, 

492
00:23:23,366 --> 00:23:27,666
wanting to break out of the Quietest period.

We have done it on occasion,

500
00:24:00,766 --> 00:24:02,699
but we do not have it in every service

501
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:04,400
like some Friends churches do.

One of the ways that the Evangelical movement has probably

504
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:17,566
affected us as Evangelical Friends is,

505
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:19,600
in some ways, impacting music.

506
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,500
In more recent years,

507
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,966
with a desire to reach out to new people,

508
00:24:23,966 --> 00:24:25,866
to bring people into the faith,

509
00:24:26,366 --> 00:24:28,365
music is a huge part of that. 

510
00:24:28,365 --> 00:24:32,499
And so more contemporary styles of music is more appealing,

511
00:24:32,500 --> 00:24:34,266
especially to some of the younger ones

512
00:24:34,266 --> 00:24:36,099
and that's the ones that we want to reach.

513
00:25:03,166 --> 00:25:08,299
The roots of this Quaker diversity also lie in the 19th century,

515
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:13,466
when American friends responded in different ways

516
00:25:13,533 --> 00:25:17,799
to movements and the larger American religious culture.

518
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:21,866
The first of those splits took place in the 1820s,

519
00:25:22,066 --> 00:25:24,199
when American Quaker is divided

520
00:25:24,333 --> 00:25:27,358
into Orthodox and Hicksite groups.

521
00:25:27,358 --> 00:25:30,327
At the center of this separation was 

522
00:25:30,327 --> 00:25:34,333
a Quaker minister from Long Island named Elias Hicks,

524
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:38,866
who became a lightning rod for Quaker controversy

525
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:42,500
when he argued that there were parts of the Bible

526
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:45,499
that were not truly inspired.

527
00:25:46,133 --> 00:25:48,330
Probably no aspect of their history is 

528
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,666
a source of greater pride for quakers

530
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:54,200
than their central role in the crusade against slavery.

531
00:25:54,800 --> 00:25:58,800
Lucretia Coffin was born on Nantucket to a Quaker family.

533
00:25:59,533 --> 00:26:02,700
She would become known as the most famous woman in America

535
00:26:02,700 --> 00:26:06,400
for her role as an abolitionist and as a leader

536
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:08,666
in the struggle for women's rights.

537
00:26:10,966 --> 00:26:14,666
By the time she married James mott and moved to Philadelphia,

539
00:26:14,666 --> 00:26:16,766
she was poised for activism.

540
00:26:17,133 --> 00:26:21,166
In 1833, Mott joined forces with other women,

541
00:26:21,166 --> 00:26:22,766
black as well as white,

542
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:24,966
Quaker and non Quaker,

543
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:29,400
in organizing the Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society.

545
00:26:29,733 --> 00:26:33,533
It would become the strongest such organization in the nation.

547
00:26:34,333 --> 00:26:37,699
Lucretia was the driving force behind the construction

548
00:26:37,866 --> 00:26:41,333
of the imposing Pennsylvania Hall in Philadelphia.

549
00:26:41,733 --> 00:26:44,234
It was intended to be the center 

550
00:26:44,234 --> 00:26:47,066
of abolitionist activity in the country.

551
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,766
Angelina and Sarah Grimke, Quaker converts,

553
00:26:51,766 --> 00:26:54,966
were among the few southern women abolitionists.

554
00:26:54,966 --> 00:26:57,399
They were the daughters of a prominent Charleston,

555
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,733
South Carolina's slave-owning family.

556
00:26:59,800 --> 00:27:02,166
Both left the South for Philadelphia,

557
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:04,566
where they could speak out against slavery.

558
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,366
On April 17, 1838,

559
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,133
3 days after the opening of Pennsylvania Hall,

560
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:14,683
Angelina Grimke took the rostrum 

561
00:27:14,683 --> 00:27:18,466
before a full integrated audience of both sexes.

563
00:27:20,900 --> 00:27:22,100
As a southerner,

564
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:25,700
I feel it is my duty to stand up here tonight

565
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:28,466
and bear testimony against slavery.

566
00:27:28,966 --> 00:27:30,333
I have seen it.

567
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:31,966
I have seen it.

568
00:27:31,966 --> 00:27:36,266
I know it has horrors that can never be described.

569
00:27:36,766 --> 00:27:38,866
I was brought up under its wing.

570
00:27:39,666 --> 00:27:41,399
Our witness for many years

571
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:43,466
it's demoralizing influence

572
00:27:43,566 --> 00:27:46,899
and its destructiveness to human happiness.

573
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:48,599
The next day,

574
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,333
an incensed mob set the 3-story structure of fire.

575
00:27:52,566 --> 00:27:55,999
The Quaker journalist and poet John Greenleaf Whittier,

576
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:59,566
editor of the abolitionist journal "The Freedman",

577
00:27:59,566 --> 00:28:01,533
emerged from the burning building after

578
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:03,899
rescuing manuscripts from his office.

579
00:28:04,666 --> 00:28:06,966
Lucretia Mott spoke out against

580
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:11,899
slavery in a variety of venues within Quaker meetings,

582
00:28:12,066 --> 00:28:13,499
but also in public.

583
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:17,966
And she and others women were willing to speak before mixed,

585
00:28:17,966 --> 00:28:20,766
sometimes called "promiscuous" audiences,

586
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,499
meaning men and women.

587
00:28:23,166 --> 00:28:28,599
And this scandalized a number of people in that era in Philadelphia.

589
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:32,811
And so they were criticized sometimes less as abolitionist 

590
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:36,933
and more for women being public speakers.

592
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,333
And so she becomes involved and 

593
00:28:39,333 --> 00:28:43,800
what was seen as the first women's rights meeting

594
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:47,700
the Seneca Falls Convention of July 1848.

595
00:28:48,466 --> 00:28:50,399
And 4 of the 5 people

596
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:54,000
who called and organized that meeting were Quakers.

597
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:56,299
Films, phonograph records,

598
00:28:56,300 --> 00:28:58,900
and cartoons depicted the suffragists

599
00:28:58,900 --> 00:29:02,333
as unsexed women trying to ape men.

00:29:12,066 --> 00:29:15,666

605
00:29:15,666 --> 00:29:17,866
In the 19th and 20th centuries,

606
00:29:17,866 --> 00:29:21,166
many attempts were made to continue silencing women.

607
00:29:21,900 --> 00:29:27,466
Suffragists campaigned and struggled successively for 72 years

609
00:29:27,466 --> 00:29:30,166
before winning the right to vote in 1920.

610
00:29:31,800 --> 00:29:33,456
Susan B. Anthony was jailed 

611
00:29:33,456 --> 00:29:36,899
for publicly casting a vote along with men.

612
00:29:40,766 --> 00:29:43,766
Alice Paul was arrested and thrown in prison.

613
00:29:48,966 --> 00:29:51,933
She was on a hunger strike when she was force-fed

614
00:29:51,933 --> 00:29:54,466
with a tube through her nostrils.

615
00:29:57,466 --> 00:30:02,199
Alice Paul was 8th generation Quaker in this country,

616
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:08,733
and she was very familiar with their lack of respect for authority.

618
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:13,866
Alice Paul arrives in Washington at the end of 1912,

619
00:30:14,400 --> 00:30:18,153
and she has a mandate from the National American 

620
00:30:18,153 --> 00:30:22,266
Woman Suffrage Association to organize a parade.

622
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:27,966
It will be the day before Woodrow Wilson is inaugurated,

623
00:30:28,066 --> 00:30:33,099
and it attracts as many as 200 000 onlookers,

625
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:36,633
which in Washington men was unheard of 

626
00:30:36,633 --> 00:30:39,266
and even large by today's standards.

627
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:42,733
About 4 blocks into the parade, the crowds break through,

628
00:30:42,733 --> 00:30:45,733
and they spill into the path of the parade.

630
00:30:45,733 --> 00:30:47,133
Most of them are men.

631
00:30:47,266 --> 00:30:48,533
They've been drinking.

632
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,566
They hurt all insults at the women.

633
00:30:50,566 --> 00:30:53,466
They spit at them, they tear at their clothing.

634
00:30:53,533 --> 00:30:57,099
The women were under orders not to fight back.

636
00:30:57,566 --> 00:31:00,333
This was nonviolent resistance.

637
00:31:00,733 --> 00:31:03,733
The police show very little interest in bringing order.

638
00:31:03,733 --> 00:31:06,766
They turn their backs on the parade, they're laughing.

640
00:31:06,766 --> 00:31:10,236
Now you would think Alice Paul would had been devastated,

641
00:31:08,966 --> 00:31:10,799
but no.

642
00:31:10,236 --> 00:31:12,926
She saw that this near-riot 

643
00:31:12,926 --> 00:31:15,299
on the front pages of newspapers

644
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,836
across the America was a better story 

645
00:31:17,836 --> 00:31:19,266
than her parade would have been,

646
00:31:19,266 --> 00:31:22,800
and she was in fact a public relations genius.

648
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:30,499
She was truly a leader and nonviolent resistance.

649
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:33,000
The first people ever to pick at the White House,

650
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,400
the first social protest parade in Washington...

651
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,166
She really blazed a trail.

652
00:31:43,266 --> 00:31:46,621
And I think she was to suffrage 

653
00:31:46,621 --> 00:31:49,966
what Martin Luther king was to civil rights.

636
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:51,875
♪ Hurrah, hurrah.

637
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:55,946
♪ Hurrah for the suffragettes.


655
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,866
I am so moved when I think about women

656
00:31:59,866 --> 00:32:01,733
standing in front of the White House,

657
00:32:02,266 --> 00:32:04,099
demanding their right to vote,

658
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,366
even in the midst of a war.

659
00:32:06,700 --> 00:32:09,666
And it was a very real risk and women went to jail.

660
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:13,366
But I wouldn't have just been able to vote

661
00:32:13,933 --> 00:32:16,366
if that weren't the case,

662
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:21,066
if she didn't do the hunger strikes that she had done in jail and

664
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:23,466
the way that she pulled other women in

665
00:32:23,466 --> 00:32:26,999
and had a big vision for what was actually possible

666
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,800
and took tremendous risk herself.

667
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:32,166
And I stand on her shoulders.

668
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:35,533
PNC was claiming to be a green bank

669
00:32:35,533 --> 00:32:38,699
and they also are a bank with Quaker roots.

670
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:42,866
And a lot of Quaker institutions still had their money in PNC 

671
00:32:42,866 --> 00:32:44,966
because of that historic connection.

672
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:48,566
And so it seemed to us to be a way

674
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:52,366
to tackle these big issues of justice and climate change

676
00:32:52,566 --> 00:32:57,066
by going after one target and having a sustained campaign.

678
00:32:57,300 --> 00:33:00,616
And so we worked on, for 5 years, 

680
00:33:00,616 --> 00:33:03,647
getting PNC to withdraw that financing 

681
00:33:03,647 --> 00:33:05,766
from mountaintop removal coal mining.

682
00:33:06,766 --> 00:33:10,199
Quaker organizations come to Friends Fiduciary

683
00:33:10,266 --> 00:33:13,399
as a group to incorporate Quaker values

684
00:33:13,399 --> 00:33:16,899
in the financial stewardship of their assets.

686
00:33:17,100 --> 00:33:21,546
So we manage about 350,000,000 in assets for 

688
00:33:21,546 --> 00:33:25,366
Quaker meetings, churches and schools across the country.

689
00:33:26,066 --> 00:33:28,166
Because Earth Quaker Action Team

690
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,000
primarily involves Quakers,

691
00:33:30,166 --> 00:33:31,866
there's a certain affinity

692
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:34,733
between Earth Quaker Action Team and

693
00:33:34,766 --> 00:33:38,133
Friends Fiduciary because we serve Quaker organizations.

694
00:33:39,066 --> 00:33:42,599
Friends Fiduciary co-filed a shareholder proposal

695
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:44,866
with Boston Common Asset Management,

696
00:33:44,866 --> 00:33:46,099
one of our partners,

697
00:33:46,133 --> 00:33:47,866
asking for the company

698
00:33:48,266 --> 00:33:49,666
in this particular case

699
00:33:49,666 --> 00:33:52,799
to report on their greenhouse gas emissions and

700
00:33:52,933 --> 00:33:56,866
looking at climate risk in their financing portfolios, generally.

702
00:33:57,133 --> 00:34:01,466
We did civil disobedience and a big growth came in 2013,

703
00:34:02,466 --> 00:34:06,099
when we staged 15 actions on one day.

704
00:34:07,166 --> 00:34:11,733
And the last action of the day was 7 people getting arrested.

706
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:14,533
We are here...

707
00:34:15,333 --> 00:34:16,486
And we will fight.

708
00:34:16,486 --> 00:34:23,933
We need it every community a group of angelic troublemakers.

710
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:30,799
Our power is in our ability to make things unworkable.

711
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,533
We then continue to grow geographically,

712
00:34:35,733 --> 00:34:38,466
and on December 6th of 2014,

713
00:34:39,133 --> 00:34:42,729
we were able to do 31 actions 

714
00:34:42,729 --> 00:34:45,599
in 13 states in the District of Columbia.

715
00:34:45,933 --> 00:34:47,699
So I think part of what happened was

716
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:49,766
they saw we were not going away.

717
00:34:49,766 --> 00:34:50,999
We were growing.

718
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,000
we were becoming more bold.

719
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:57,699
The time that we visited the CE, Bill Demcheck, at his house,

721
00:34:57,700 --> 00:35:01,099
he actually came out and talked to our people for an hour,

723
00:35:01,666 --> 00:35:05,799
and that was assigned to me that we were really making an impact.

725
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:09,707
So it took 5 years, it took lots and lots of work,

726
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:11,676
it took lots and lots of people.

727
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,766
And we did it, they got out.

728
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,200
They were very strategic and as I said, thoughtful.

729
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:20,366
We are using Quaker worship as part of what we do

730
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:23,400
and that there's a lot of safety in that.

731
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:27,499
There's a lot of experience of community which

732
00:35:28,066 --> 00:35:32,133
everyone I know is hungry for and especially young people.

734
00:35:32,133 --> 00:35:35,166
I think especially young people are wanting community,

735
00:35:35,866 --> 00:35:37,733
aren't necessarily looking for that

736
00:35:37,733 --> 00:35:39,733
on Sunday mornings at a church,

737
00:35:40,333 --> 00:35:43,199
but want to be able to act powerfully in the world

738
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,800
and have a spiritual rootedness to that.

739
00:35:52,166 --> 00:35:56,733
John Woolman was an early Quaker abolitionist who

740
00:35:57,100 --> 00:36:00,423
wrote a journal, which has been continuously in print 

742
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:04,699
since it was published in 1775.

744
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:11,266
And it's inspired many people to follow their consciences.

746
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:16,400
He has the ability to,

748
00:36:16,533 --> 00:36:19,599
I think, put himself in other people's shoes,

749
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:25,884
this active imagination to put himself in the shoes of Indians 

751
00:36:25,884 --> 00:36:29,700
who are no longer living on the land that they used to live in.

752
00:36:30,766 --> 00:36:34,509
He puts himself in the shoes of slaves,

753
00:36:34,509 --> 00:36:36,966
slaves with Quaker masters.

754
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:41,450
He puts himself in the shoes of Quaker slave owners 

755
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:45,799
and realizes that they have pressures toward holding on to slaves

757
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:48,799
and that just freeing your slaves is not a simple decision.

759
00:36:49,266 --> 00:36:52,699
In John Woolman's part of New Jersey, West Jersey,

760
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:55,066
one in every 20 people was a slave.

761
00:36:55,666 --> 00:36:58,399
Let's imagine that John Woolman comes to visit

762
00:36:58,966 --> 00:37:01,366
someone who holds others in human bondage.

763
00:37:01,733 --> 00:37:03,333
And so he arrives,

764
00:37:03,666 --> 00:37:06,456
and the plantation owner says, 

765
00:37:06,456 --> 00:37:09,300
"Welcome, let me get you something to drink".

766
00:37:10,366 --> 00:37:14,199
So I bring out my tea and my finest silver,

768
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,566
and I say, "Will you have some tea?".

769
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:21,399
And he says, "Well, actually I don't drink from silver vessels".

771
00:37:21,766 --> 00:37:22,966
"Well, why would that be?".

772
00:37:22,966 --> 00:37:24,799
"Well, do you know where silver is mined?".

773
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:27,733
"It's mined in Caribbean, it's mined in Brazil,

774
00:37:27,933 --> 00:37:29,766
and it's not mined by free labor".

775
00:37:31,066 --> 00:37:34,766
We talk about slavery, how it is opposed to,

776
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:37,366
all religious principles,

777
00:37:37,866 --> 00:37:39,466
how it is, ...

778
00:37:40,466 --> 00:37:41,799
not just bad for the slaves,

779
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,533
but bad for the slave holders and for their children.

780
00:37:45,933 --> 00:37:48,166
Finally as John Woolman is preparing to leave,

781
00:37:48,266 --> 00:37:49,733
he reaches into his pocket,

782
00:37:49,733 --> 00:37:51,426
pulls out some coins and says, 

783
00:37:51,426 --> 00:37:54,466
"Oh, well, I understand you don't compensate

784
00:37:55,266 --> 00:37:56,666
your servants for their labor."

785
00:37:56,666 --> 00:37:59,366
"Well, I think people should be paid for what they've done,

787
00:37:59,366 --> 00:38:00,099
especially for me.

788
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:02,766
So I hope you'll give this money to your slaves".

790
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:06,919
We have 2 sides, we have the spiritual, slightly mystical side 

791
00:38:06,919 --> 00:38:10,705
and we have our action in the world side.

793
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:15,700
And John Woolman is a great example of these 2 sides,

795
00:38:17,466 --> 00:38:19,799
balancing each other and informing each other

796
00:38:20,533 --> 00:38:24,700
that what we think inwardly in how we experience the divine

798
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,533
then affects how we act in the world.

800
00:38:30,866 --> 00:38:35,612
Friends began to experience opposition from those 

802
00:38:35,612 --> 00:38:38,099
who were watching Quakers free their slaves,

803
00:38:38,100 --> 00:38:39,333
which was against the law.

804
00:38:39,733 --> 00:38:44,366
And so friends had to find ways of getting around the laws

806
00:38:44,566 --> 00:38:48,259
and eventually were very involved 

807
00:38:48,259 --> 00:38:50,266
with the Underground Railroad.

808
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:55,600
There was a large network of

809
00:38:56,133 --> 00:38:58,766
anti-slavery activists in Indiana.

810
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:01,471
Levi Coffin became a quick order, 

811
00:39:01,471 --> 00:39:05,733
a very important cog in the movement.

812
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:10,214
There was a bounty hunter who came 

813
00:39:10,214 --> 00:39:13,366
looking for his slaves here in Newport

814
00:39:13,566 --> 00:39:15,266
and was pacing outside the house

815
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:16,366
and was very frustrated

816
00:39:16,366 --> 00:39:17,999
because he could follow the

817
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:21,566
trail of fugitive slaves to Levi Coffin's house,

819
00:39:21,566 --> 00:39:23,799
but then the trail suddenly went cold.

820
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:28,733
And he said, "Well, there's an underground railroad here

822
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:32,066
and this man, Levi Coffin,  is the president of it."

823
00:39:35,366 --> 00:39:37,574
In response, Levi Coffin said, 

824
00:39:37,574 --> 00:39:39,766
he would accept the office of president.

825
00:39:39,766 --> 00:39:42,733
And he would accept any office including conductor,

826
00:39:42,733 --> 00:39:45,933
engineer, or brakeman in the Underground Railroad.

828
00:39:46,900 --> 00:39:49,440
The important thing was to  serve 

829
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,800
the cause of oppressed humanity,

830
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,533
the way that Jesus his Lord had told them to do.

831
00:40:20,166 --> 00:40:23,599
Many friends were leaders as abolitionists,

833
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:26,566
but at that time they were not seen as heroes.

834
00:40:26,566 --> 00:40:28,792
At that time, they were seen as people 

835
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,066
who were going against the norm

836
00:40:31,066 --> 00:40:35,133
and that was challenging the Religious Society of Friends

838
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,733
to stretch and to transform and to change.

839
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:40,533
Quakers were the first to

840
00:40:40,600 --> 00:40:43,733
have the religious society as a whole say

841
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:47,133
it was not appropriate to enslave people of African descent.

843
00:40:47,333 --> 00:40:51,214
But they were clear when they did this in 1776 

844
00:40:51,214 --> 00:40:54,266
that they wanted to have segregation themselves.

846
00:40:54,466 --> 00:40:57,454
So Quakers did delay integration 

847
00:40:57,454 --> 00:40:59,933
of the majority of Quaker schools.

848
00:40:59,966 --> 00:41:02,525
There were a few Quaker schools 

849
00:41:02,525 --> 00:41:06,966
that admitted some African Americans in the 1930s.

850
00:41:06,966 --> 00:41:12,399
But the majority of them didn't until after the 1950s,

852
00:41:12,400 --> 00:41:14,900
after the 1954 decision.

853
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,300
The Supreme Court's decision in Brown v. Board of Education

855
00:41:19,466 --> 00:41:22,733
meant that all public schools were ordered to desegregate.

857
00:41:23,333 --> 00:41:25,148
Yet African American applicants 

858
00:41:25,148 --> 00:41:27,399
to many Quaker schools and colleges

859
00:41:27,533 --> 00:41:30,599
still reported that they were treated differently.

860
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,666
The main reason,

861
00:41:32,866 --> 00:41:36,396
actually around the hesitation for membership and 

862
00:41:36,396 --> 00:41:40,263
for having desegregated schools was, 

863
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:43,100
there was fear of race-mixing.

My activism did not spring for my being gay

865
00:42:06,766 --> 00:42:09,266
or for that manner for my being black.

866
00:42:09,933 --> 00:42:12,299
Rather it is rooted fundamentally

867
00:42:12,366 --> 00:42:13,866
in my Quaker upbringing

868
00:42:13,866 --> 00:42:16,166
and the values that were instilled in me

869
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:18,866
by my grandparents who raised me.

870
00:42:19,400 --> 00:42:21,100
Those values are based

871
00:42:21,166 --> 00:42:24,133
on the concept of a single human family

872
00:42:24,200 --> 00:42:29,266
and the belief that all members of that family are equal.

874
00:42:30,566 --> 00:42:33,666
Bayard Rustin was born into a Quaker family.

875
00:42:34,133 --> 00:42:35,566
His grandmother was a Quaker.

876
00:42:35,566 --> 00:42:37,533
He was raised by his grandparents

877
00:42:37,900 --> 00:42:41,166
and he remained a Quaker all his life.

878
00:42:41,866 --> 00:42:44,166
His grandmother's influence was enormous.

879
00:42:45,933 --> 00:42:48,533
She was not just a Quaker, but she was also

880
00:42:48,666 --> 00:42:52,499
an activist around questions of race and race relations.

882
00:42:52,533 --> 00:42:55,166
So she was one of the charter members of the NAACP

883
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,133
and joining in 1910.

884
00:42:57,866 --> 00:43:05,966
So that she had this dual tradition that I think he was heir to

888
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:09,100
and marks his career through his entire life.

889
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,266
Rustin was enormously important in the civil rights movement

891
00:43:13,266 --> 00:43:18,933
and particularly in the 40s, 50s through most of the 60s.

893
00:43:19,566 --> 00:43:24,535
And he is instrumental in introducing a number of different 

895
00:43:24,535 --> 00:43:30,366
tactics, strategies, philosophies into the movement.

898
00:43:31,166 --> 00:43:33,599
Generally, he's the one that's given credit

899
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:37,966
for introducing King to nonviolent direct action.

the executive director

903
00:43:58,400 --> 00:44:00,966
of the committee for the March on Washington,

904
00:44:01,133 --> 00:44:04,966
the man who organized this whole thing, Mr. Bayard Rustin.

906
00:44:10,333 --> 00:44:12,333
Ladies and gentlemen,

907
00:44:12,666 --> 00:44:15,499
at 5 o'clock today...

908
00:44:16,466 --> 00:44:18,933
the leaders whom you have heard

909
00:44:19,866 --> 00:44:22,599
will go to President Kennedy

910
00:44:23,166 --> 00:44:26,899
to carry the demands of this revolution.

911
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:31,733
It is now time for you to act.

911
00:44:32,070 --> 00:44:34,003
What do you say?

912
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:38,966
Rustin's pacifist Quaker beliefs also

914
00:44:38,966 --> 00:44:42,699
led him to become a conscientious objector during World War II.

916
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:46,000
He worked for the American Friends Service Committee,

917
00:44:46,133 --> 00:44:50,733
the humanitarian organization founded by Quakers in 1917.

919
00:44:51,466 --> 00:44:52,599
I am a Quaker,

920
00:44:52,733 --> 00:44:56,199
and as everyone knows Quakers for 300 years

921
00:44:56,333 --> 00:44:58,399
have on conscientious grounds,

922
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:00,500
being against participating in war.

923
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:05,899
I was sentenced to 3 years in federal prison

924
00:45:06,066 --> 00:45:08,399
because I could not religiously

925
00:45:08,533 --> 00:45:11,699
and conscientiously accept killing my fellow man.

926
00:45:13,666 --> 00:45:16,279
The American Friend Service Committee was founded 

927
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:21,584
as a means of providing young Quaker men 

928
00:45:21,584 --> 00:45:24,333
an alternative to military service.

929
00:45:24,866 --> 00:45:27,023
Byard Rustin was an employee 

930
00:45:27,023 --> 00:45:29,733
of the American Friend Service Committee in the 50s,

932
00:45:29,766 --> 00:45:34,266
helped author the famous pamphlet "Speak Truth to Power"

933
00:45:34,533 --> 00:45:37,699
about the Korean War and nuclear proliferation

934
00:45:37,866 --> 00:45:40,166
and militarism in American Society.

935
00:45:40,533 --> 00:45:43,799
First editions of that famous pamphlet

936
00:45:43,900 --> 00:45:person 
did not include his name because he was an openly gay person,

937
00:45:person  --> 00:45:49,045
and even the American Friend Service Committee

938
00:45:49,045 --> 00:45:52,166
in the 1950s couldn't grapple with that.

939
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:57,066
It was not until 2013 that Rustin was finally given his due

941
00:45:57,300 --> 00:45:59,033
when he posthumously received 

942
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:01,699
the Medal of Freedom from President Obama.

943
00:46:05,700 --> 00:46:08,865
Herbert Hoover is seen by many of the period 

944
00:46:08,865 --> 00:46:12,869
as this upright, upstanding, virtuous 

945
00:46:12,869 --> 00:46:14,999
emblem of what quakerism should be.

946
00:46:15,133 --> 00:46:17,299

Herbert Hoover was elected

950
00:46:23,800 --> 00:46:27,700
president on the Republican ticket in 1929,

951
00:46:27,700 --> 00:46:30,566
the year of the massive stock market crash.

952
00:46:31,666 --> 00:46:35,066
In the face of mounting unemployment and food schiscity,

953
00:46:35,066 --> 00:46:37,733
he insisted that it would be morally wrong

954
00:46:37,733 --> 00:46:40,266
for the Federal Government to provide the help

956
00:46:40,266 --> 00:46:42,699
that neighbors should be giving one another.

957
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,666
As a result, he owned the depression

958
00:46:46,700 --> 00:46:49,566
and every cluster of shacks around the country,

959
00:46:49,566 --> 00:46:53,266
of which there were many became known as Hoovervills.



961
00:46:53,266 --> 00:46:54,333

00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:06,500
Richard Nixon was a California Quaker,

963
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:09,100
and what that means is that California Quakerism

964
00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:11,600
tends to be more evangelically inflected

965
00:47:11,766 --> 00:47:13,299
than other kinds of Quakerism.

966
00:47:13,866 --> 00:47:17,066
So Nixon growing up wouldn't have had silent worship.

967
00:47:17,066 --> 00:47:18,866
He wouldn't have had a minister

968
00:47:18,933 --> 00:47:21,199
and so becoming an adult,

969
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:24,366
Nixon viewed himself firmly in a Quaker tradition

970
00:47:24,366 --> 00:47:25,866
that came from his mother.

971
00:47:26,066 --> 00:47:28,399
But it was also an evangelical tradition.

972
00:47:28,466 --> 00:47:30,266
Nixon and Hoover are friends.

973
00:47:30,300 --> 00:47:32,000
And I do think there's probably a connection

974
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:34,050
between them both being Quakers

975
00:47:34,050 --> 00:47:36,166
 in terms of their close affinity to each other.

976
00:47:36,166 --> 00:47:38,321
So Nixon is sort of a protégé 

977
00:47:38,321 --> 00:47:41,499
of this old lion at the Republican Party.

978
00:47:41,900 --> 00:47:42,700
Herbert Hoover,

979
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:44,933
when he had been the first Quaker president,

980
00:47:44,933 --> 00:47:46,866
had gone to Washington meeting.

981
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:48,566
Nixon doesn't do that

982
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,733
because it's an unprogram meeting

983
00:47:50,733 --> 00:47:52,599
and that means that anybody can speak.

984
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,100
They can't have him in an unprogram meeting

985
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:57,033
because he's just going to be attacked 

986
00:47:57,033 --> 00:47:58,999
the entire time over the Vietnam War.

987
00:47:59,466 --> 00:48:00,899
Nixon decides that he's going to

988
00:48:00,900 --> 00:48:03,133
hold a series of worship services

989
00:48:03,133 --> 00:48:05,533
inside the White House in the east room,

991
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:07,689
going to invite a number of different 

992
00:48:07,689 --> 00:48:10,340
religious leaders in order to lead them.

993
00:48:10,340 --> 00:48:11,566
It's by invitation only

994
00:48:11,566 --> 00:48:13,799
and a lot of the people who receive an invitation

996
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,000
also happen to be Republican donors or people

997
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,300
that the White House particularly wants to impress

998
00:48:19,300 --> 00:48:21,100
by getting them close to the president.

999
00:48:21,366 --> 00:48:23,166
Others saw him as a hypocrite.

1000
00:48:23,733 --> 00:48:26,866
They referred to him as "The Bombing Quaker".

1001
00:48:27,266 --> 00:48:30,399
And I thought that was a terrible...

1002
00:48:31,966 --> 00:48:34,266
juxtaposition of words

1003
00:48:34,266 --> 00:48:37,866
because how could you associate that with Quakerism?

1004
00:48:38,366 --> 00:48:41,851
I had become familiar with the Quaker peace testimony,

1006
00:48:41,851 --> 00:48:45,933
that it was... Philadelphia yearly meaning had copies of it

1007
00:48:45,933 --> 00:48:48,099
that were readily available.

1008
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,066
So every day, no matter where we were,

1009
00:48:51,066 --> 00:48:54,099
I had to get to a mailbox first thing in the morning

1010
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:56,166
so I could get it in the mail.

1011
00:48:56,266 --> 00:48:58,966
I mean, all this talk about Quaker heritage,

1012
00:48:58,966 --> 00:49:01,733
and I wanted to remind him that

1013
00:49:01,733 --> 00:49:05,099
what he was doing was certainly not very Quakerly.

1014
00:49:05,366 --> 00:49:09,679
So in terms of protesters, Nixon is obviously very upset 

1015
00:49:09,679 --> 00:49:12,166
by the fact that people are protesting ham,

1016
00:49:12,266 --> 00:49:15,333
protesting his actions in Vietnam.

1017
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:17,366
He's particularly upset by the fact that

1018
00:49:17,366 --> 00:49:20,800
Quakers are doing so and so their various remarks

1020
00:49:20,800 --> 00:49:23,133
Nixon makes to his staff and to others

1021
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:26,133
that indicate Nixon doesn't see them as real Quakers.

1022
00:49:26,166 --> 00:49:27,999
Nixon makes the argument, for instance,

1023
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,500
that people who are Quakers

1024
00:49:29,500 --> 00:49:31,100
protesting outside the White House

1025
00:49:31,100 --> 00:49:34,036
must all have recently joined Quakerism 

1026
00:49:34,036 --> 00:49:35,766
in order to, like, dodge the draft.

1027
00:49:41,933 --> 00:49:45,733
There is an very honored history within Quakerism

1028
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:48,699
of participating, even creating, generating,

1030
00:49:48,733 --> 00:49:51,399
designing non-violent direct action campaigns

1031
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,533
that enable masses of people to participate

1032
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:57,800
and get something done despite the opposition.

1034
00:50:00,466 --> 00:50:03,466
The "Yacht Phoenix" has self-ordained mercy ship manned

1036
00:50:03,466 --> 00:50:06,399
by a crew of 7 determined American pacifists.

1037
00:50:06,400 --> 00:50:07,266
Its mission?

1038
00:50:07,333 --> 00:50:08,899
To bring medical supplies to the 

1039
00:50:08,899 --> 00:50:12,300
North Vietnamese port of Hai Phong despite Red Cross warnings

1041
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:14,100
and without State Department clearance.

1042
00:50:14,466 --> 00:50:18,199
I felt like I had no choice but to offer myself,

1043
00:50:18,333 --> 00:50:21,354
because I was compelled by the spirit. 

1044
00:50:21,354 --> 00:50:25,466
I think a key decision

1046
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:28,933
that friends need to make is whether

1047
00:50:29,100 --> 00:50:33,286
to pay attention to the people who look us over 

1048
00:50:33,286 --> 00:50:35,999
and that would include young people,

1050
00:50:36,133 --> 00:50:38,766
because this is a time of spiritual searching.

1051
00:50:39,366 --> 00:50:42,806
So what is special about a Quaker school, 

1052
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:46,842
as opposed to a non-Quaker school  or a public school?

1053
00:50:46,842 --> 00:50:48,566
What do we do differently here?

1054
00:50:49,500 --> 00:50:52,266
- Alley.  - We believe in spices.

1055
00:50:52,333 --> 00:50:54,366
The spices, yes. the spices.

1056
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:56,652
So what are the spices?

1057
00:50:56,652 --> 00:50:58,366
Florence.

1058
00:50:58,566 --> 00:51:01,199
The 'S' stands for simplicity.

1059
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:07,533
S-I-M-P-L-I-C-I-T-Y.

1060
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:11,466
- 'P' stands for peace.   - Peace.

1062
00:51:12,300 --> 00:51:15,610
The 'I' is sometimes a little tough, Beatrice?

1063
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,766
I think it stands for integrity.

1064
00:51:17,766 --> 00:51:20,133
What does integrity mean?

1065
00:51:20,133 --> 00:51:21,566
That's a really tough question

1066
00:51:21,566 --> 00:51:23,566
because it's a nice big, tough word.

1068
00:51:24,500 --> 00:51:25,550
Alana, do you...

1069
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,099
You were doing the right thing even when nobody's looking.

1070
00:51:29,200 --> 00:51:31,466
That is a wonderful answer.

1071
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:33,423
When you open up the dialogue 

1072
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:37,099
and you allow students to really grapple with issues

1074
00:51:37,100 --> 00:51:40,966
and really talk about it in a way that is meaningful and tolerant,

1076
00:51:41,133 --> 00:51:44,266
then they feel like they have a stake in the matter.

1078
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:48,100
The future of Quakerism may rest on new kinds of outreach.

1080
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:50,199
We live in the age of the internet,

1081
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:53,699
so Quakers are knit together in a really new way

1082
00:51:53,700 --> 00:51:56,633
because we're Quakers have split  

1083
00:51:56,633 --> 00:51:58,700
over the years from the 17th century.

1084
00:51:58,700 --> 00:52:00,800
We've become evangelical Quakers 

1085
00:52:00,800 --> 00:52:03,900
and liberal Quakers and conservative Quakers.

1087
00:52:03,900 --> 00:52:06,466
And mostly in the past couple of centuries,

1088
00:52:06,466 --> 00:52:09,099
we haven't interacted between those branches at all.

1089
00:52:09,100 --> 00:52:10,366
But now that we're on the internet,

1090
00:52:10,366 --> 00:52:12,533
there might be something exciting that's about to happen.

1092
00:52:12,533 --> 00:52:14,899
And there might be a revival of Quakerism

1093
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:16,566
coming up in the next 20 years.

1094
00:52:16,566 --> 00:52:18,666
♪ And he wore plain clothes

1095
00:52:19,766 --> 00:52:21,299
♪ And he was strong

1096
00:52:23,266 --> 00:52:27,366
♪ And there were 60,000 Quakers

1098
00:52:27,466 --> 00:52:29,166
♪ When he was done

1099
00:52:45,800 --> 00:52:49,300
Most Quakers view the combined experience of silence

1100
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,333
and communion with God's light

1101
00:52:51,366 --> 00:52:53,333
to be at the heart of the faith.

1102
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:57,733
Both early Friends as well as modern day Quakers

1103
00:52:57,800 --> 00:53:00,200
have always been guided by the light.

1104
00:53:02,766 --> 00:53:05,166
James Tyrell, the Quaker artist,

1105
00:53:05,400 --> 00:53:09,166
experiments and plays with color as its affected by light.

1107
00:53:09,733 --> 00:53:13,099
Some Friends experience it as divine radiance.

1108
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,066
I attend this meeting house, Chestnut Hill,

1109
00:53:16,500 --> 00:53:21,166
and I love the meditative peaceful space

1111
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:23,733
of just laying down and surrendering.

1112
00:53:24,100 --> 00:53:28,599
I love the exposure to the elements in the sky,

1114
00:53:28,600 --> 00:53:29,966
and the wind and the clouds

1115
00:53:29,966 --> 00:53:32,099
and the things that you can't control

1116
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:34,900
or that are greater than ourselves

1117
00:53:35,066 --> 00:53:39,600
and that's framed by this rectangle in the roof.

1119
00:53:51,000 --> 00:53:54,930
All of what we're doing is spiritual.

1120
00:53:54,930 --> 00:53:57,933
It is about that of God in each of us.

1121
00:54:14,366 --> 00:54:16,733
It's about the respect we have for each other.

1122
00:54:17,933 --> 00:54:20,499
It's about the responsibility we each carry.

1123
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:23,966
And so it's been so exciting to me to see people,

1124
00:54:24,466 --> 00:54:26,799
whether they become ultimately Quaker or not,

1125
00:54:27,566 --> 00:54:32,768
finding what does it mean to sit in a gathered group in silence?

1126
00:54:32,768 --> 00:54:36,905
What does it mean to speak coming out of that silence,

1127
00:54:36,955 --> 00:54:40,199
to speak that deep, capital T, truth?

1129
00:54:40,566 --> 00:54:43,466
And so I've seen these, like, people blossoming

1130
00:54:43,566 --> 00:54:46,599
because it's a way of saying, "Yes, I don't have to have

1131
00:54:46,866 --> 00:54:49,599
my faith over here and my activism over here".

1132
00:54:50,166 --> 00:54:52,266
They can actually be one.
