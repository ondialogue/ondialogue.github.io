1
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:20,033
我们完全否认一切外部的战争和冲突,
We utterly deny all outward wars and strife,

3
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,767
以及为了任何目的
and fighting with outward weapons,

00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,667
或以任何借口而用外部武器进行战斗,
for any end, or under any pretense whatsoever;

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,200
这是我们对世界的见证。
this is our testimony to the world...

6
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:34,767
这是“和平证词”，

00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:47,033
自称为“光明之子”
and calling themselves the "children of light",

10
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:50,033
或者“真相出版商”
or "publishers of truth."

11
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,800
对他们的批评者来说，他们被称为“贵格会教徒”
To their critics they were known as "Quakers,"

12
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,600
他们毫不掩饰地承认的嘲弄性的绰号
a derisive nickname that they unabashedly acknowledged

13
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:59,233
因为他们在酒精的影响下颤抖而闻名

00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,367
在他们的崇拜会议的圣灵。

最终，他们将正式命名自己
Ultimately, they would officially name themselves

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,400
“友朋会”
"The Religious Society of Friends."

17
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:14,200
他们富有远见的领袖乔治 · 福克斯在1683年写道:
Their visionary leader, George Fox, wrote in 1683:

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
“上帝创造了一切,
"God, who made all,

19
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:21,667
把祂的灵魂倾注在世界上所有的男人和女人身上,
pours out his spirit upon all men and women in the world,

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,200
在他新约的日子里,
in the days of his new covenant,

21
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:30,433
是的，在白人和黑人，荒原，土耳其人和印第安人,
yea, upon whites and blacks, moors, and turks, and Indians,

22
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:36,700
基督徒，犹太人，外邦人，都带着上帝的精神,
Christians, Jews, and gentiles, that all with the spirit of God,

23
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:40,300
可能知道上帝和上帝的事情,
might know God and the things of God,

24
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:45,333
在精神和真理上服务和崇拜。”。
and serve and worship, in spirit and truth".

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,167
成为模式，成为所有国家的榜样,
Be patterns, be examples in all countries,

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,667
地方，岛屿，国家，无论你来到哪里,

00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,300
你的马车

生命可以在各种各样的人中传道,

00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:01,833
和他们;
and to them;

30
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:06,033
然后你就可以高高兴兴地走遍世界,
then you will come to walk cheerfully over the world,

31
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:09,367
回答每一个上帝的问题。
answering that of God in every one.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,533
每个人心中都有上帝，就像它最初被使用的那样,
That of God in everyone as it was originally used,

33
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,767
其实指的是被制造出来的人

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,667
以上帝的形象和肖像。
in the image and likeness of God.

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,400
我们都有同一个父亲，同一对父母。
We all share the same Father with the same parents.

36
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,700
我们都是上帝的孩子,
We're all children of God,

37
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:27,967
我们都是同一个上帝的孩子。
we're all children of the same God.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,700
我们需要认识到这就是我们需要回应的
We need to recognize that that's what we need to be responding to

39
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,600
在其他人身上，这就是共同的人性
in other people, is that common humanity

40
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:38,167
我们所拥有的，基督的内在之光。

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,200
就像太阳的光芒
And just as the light from the sun

42
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:45,133
让我们用眼睛看，我们的外在的眼睛,
allows us to see with our eyes, our outward eyes,

43
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,600
我们有向内的眼睛
we have inward eyes

44
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:51,767
当我们被上帝内在之光照亮时,
and when we are illuminated by that inward light of God,

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,467
我们可以看到我们的精神状态

46
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,533
明白上帝要我们做什么。
and understand what it is God's calling on us to do.

47
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,467
随着运动数量和势头的增加,
As the movement grew in number and momentum,

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,533
内心的光引导贵格会成为关键角色

49
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,600
在许多最具变革性的时刻
in many of the most transformative moments

50
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:10,100
在过去的四个世纪里。
of the last four centuries.

51
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:15,367
贵格会教徒，如威廉潘，苏珊·安东尼，露迪雅莫特,
Quakers such as William Penn, Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott,

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,333
约翰 · 伍尔曼和乔治 · 吉百利
John Woolman and George Cadbury

53
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,433
获得了一定程度的名声,
have achieved a degree of fame,

54
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:24,333
但对其他成千上万的朋友知之甚少,
but less is known about thousands of other Friends,

55
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:27,200
比如那些来自美国中西部的,
such as those from the American midwest,

56
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,667
他们对贵格会理想的忠诚
whose faithfulness to Quaker ideals

57
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,433
对整个社会产生了积极的影响。
positively impacted the larger society.

58
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:37,200
这些是以前没有讲过的故事
And these are the previously untold stories

59
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:41,267
一些和平与平等的建筑师。
of some of those architects of peace and equality.

61
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,233
贵格会教徒在17世纪离开英格兰
Quakers left England in the 17th century

62
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:17,067
在新世界建立殖民地
to establish a colony in the new world -

63
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,333
William Penn 的“神圣实验”-
William Penn's "Holy Experiment" -

64
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,767
受到生活在可以被统治的地方的启发
inspired by the idea of living where they could be governed

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,533
根据他们的信仰。
according to their faith.

66
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:29,200
国王查理二世把这块土地赐给了佩恩
Penn had been given the land by King Charles II

67
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:32,300
解决一大笔家庭债务。
to settle a large family debt.

68
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,200
所以在1682年，他横渡大洋
So in 1682, he sails across the ocean

69
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:42,067
和一群殖民者在一起，他们大部分是贵格会教徒。
with a group of colonists, most of whom are Quakers.

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,167
但他没有对已经住在那里的人说,
But he doesn't say to the people already living there,

71
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,100
“这是我的”
"This is mine."

72
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,533
他说: “我要买下它。”
What he says is, "I am going to buy it.",

73
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:54,333
他不仅对瑞典人和荷兰人这么说。
he says this not only to the Swedes and the Dutch.

75
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:57,167
他对印第安人也这么说。
He says it to the Indians as well.

76
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,100
他说，这是我们想要定居的土地。
He says, "This is land that we want to settle on.

77
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,600
我们承认这是你们的土地
"we recognize it as your land

78
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:05,533
我们会向你们购买
and we will purchase it from you,"

79
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:10,133
首先是条约的数量
and begins, the first are the number of treaties

80
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:17,300
潘和他的儿子们和印第安人一起买地
that Pen and his sons make with the Indians to buy land

81
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,567
国王已经给了宾夕法尼亚大学。
that the king has already given to Penn.

82
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,633
在遇到佩恩之后,
After an encounter with Penn,

83
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:28,500
特拉华土著酋长 Tamanend 宣称:
Tamanend, a native american delaware chief, declared:

84
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,367
我们会爱上 William Penn
"We will live in love with William Penn

85
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,133
和他的孩子只要小溪和河流流淌,
and his children as long as the creeks and rivers run,

86
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:39,567
只要太阳，月亮和星星还在。
and while the sun, moon, and stars endure.

87
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,233
这部宪法是佩恩写的
Penn writes this constitution

88
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:47,267
允许人们自由崇拜,
allowing people freedom to worship,

89
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,267
废除死刑，除非..
abolishing the death penalty except in some very--

90
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,333
我认为如果你犯了叛国罪你还是会被处死,
I think if you engaged in treason you still be executed,

91
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:03,667
但除此之外，这是一份惊人的自由主义文件
but beyond that, this was an amazingly liberal document

92
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,233
他拼凑起来的。
that he put together.

93
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,500
宾夕法尼亚州的贵格会教徒聚居地,
The Quaker colony, Pennsylvania,

94
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,333
向所有人开放，并受法律管辖
was open to all and governed with laws

95
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:15,700
建立在平等、真理、简单与和平的基础上。
based on equality, truth, simplicity and peace.

96
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:22,467
和平需要正义，正义需要法律。
Peace requires justice, justice requires law.

97
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,733
法律要求政府,
law requires government,

98
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:27,433
不仅在国家内部，而且在国家之间。
not only within nations but also between nations.

99
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:31,133
William Penn 1693年。
~~ william penn, 1693.

100
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,567
如果你能建立一个国家
If you could only build a state

101
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,200
在那里人们可以自由,
where people would be free,

102
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,800
他们可以有宗教自由,
they could have freedom of religion,

103
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,367
他们可以有表达自己的自由,
they could have freedom to express themselves,

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
可以有平等,
there could be equality,

105
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:46,700
女人可以和男人一样平等，可以拥有同样的权利,
women could be as equal as men, could have the same rights,

106
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,500
可以做和人类一样的事情,
could do the same things as men,

107
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,100
不再需要拥有奴隶,
there would be no need to own slaves,

108
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:56,267
每个人都会以自己的方式给予社区,
that each in their own way would give to the community,

109
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,733
你会有一个公正的政府,
that you would have a just government,

110
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:04,600
照顾社会上的每一个人。
that would look out for everyone within the society.

111
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:08,267
不幸的是，到了美国独立战争时期,
Unfortunately, by the time of the American revolution,

112
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,433
在宾夕法尼亚州，非贵格会教徒比贵格会教徒多,
there were more non-Quakers than Quakers in Pennsylvania,

113
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,700
神圣的实验结束了
and the Holy Experiment came to an end

114
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:17,300
贵格会被投票淘汰
as Quakers were voted out of office

115
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,700
或者离职，而不是参与决策
or left office rather than participate in decisions

116
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,533
与制造战争有关。
related to war-making.

117
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:27,133
他以为他要建立一个乌托邦,
He thought he was going to establish a utopia,

118
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:35,033
一个人间天堂，却发现生活的残酷现实
a heaven on earth and found out that the tough realities of life

119
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,567
真的很碍事。
really get in the way.

120
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:44,267
但他确实创造了这个殖民地，他创造了这个模型。
But he did create this colony, he created this model.

121
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,800
我们有宗教自由的典范
We have the model of religious freedom

122
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,767
佩恩在宾夕法尼亚州建立的。
that Penn establishes in Pennsylvania.

123
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,667
还有 Unites States 的宪法,
And the constitution of the Unites States,

124
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,467
在某种程度上借鉴了他在17世纪80年代写的东西,
in some ways draws on things that he wrote in the 1680s,

125
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,300
将近100年前。
almost 100 years earlier.

126
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:06,500
虽然他们不再是宾夕法尼亚州的多数党,
Though they were no longer a majority in Pennsylvania,

128
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,500
贵格会教徒遍布美洲殖民地
Quakers had spread throughout the American colonies

129
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:13,067
在新泽西州的罗德岛有大量定居点,
with substantial settlements in rhode island, New Jersey,

130
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,533
弗吉尼亚州，南北卡罗来纳州和乔治亚州。
Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia.

132
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,500
随着新大陆殖民地的发展,
As the colonies in the new land developed,

133
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:34,500
奴隶制成为经济体系的一部分。
slavery became a part of the economic system.

134
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:38,467
但贵格会教徒走上了一条不同的道路。
But Quakers were to follow a different path.

135
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,300
整个18世纪，朋友们鼓励那些拥有奴隶的成员
Through the 1700s, friends urged their members who owned slaves

136
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,533
解放他们，为他们的福利做好准备
to free them and make provisions for their welfare

137
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:52,600
到1784年基本上没有贵格会教徒拥有奴隶。
and by 1784 virtually no Quakers owned slaves.

138
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:57,067
奴隶经济在南方变得强大,
The slave economy became strong in the south,

139
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,767
所以在1806年，我的贵格会家族
so in 1806 my family group of Quakers

140
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,033
从 North Carolina Piedmont 地区搬到俄亥俄州。
move from the North Carolina Piedmont area, to Ohio.

141
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:11,767
他们不想在那个奴隶制社会中养育自己的孩子。
They did not want to raise their children in that slave society.

142
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,800
所以这是一个有意识的问题，也是一个经济问题,
So it was a matter of conscious and also a matter of economics,

143
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,133
寻找更好的生活
a matter of looking for a life that would be better

144
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,367
为了他们的社区和家庭。
for their community and their families.

145
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:28,700
他们被周围残酷的奴隶制吓坏了,
Appalled by the cruelty of slavery around them,

146
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,433
被这种可能性所吸引
and attracted to the possibility

147
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:33,267
生活在禁止奴隶制的地方,
of living where slavery was prohibited,

148
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,467
许多南方贵格会教徒开始迁移
many southern Quakers began moving

149
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,333
西北地区,
to the northwest territory,

150
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,267
首先定居在土地上，现在包括
settling first on land that now includes

151
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,467
俄亥俄州和印第安纳州。
the states of Ohio and Indiana.

152
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,267
1787年国会通过了西北法令,
In 1787 congress passed the northwest ordinance,

153
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,600
为政府的组织提供条件

154
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:59,600
以及俄亥俄河以北土地的定居。
and settlement of the lands north of the Ohio river.

155
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:03,433
什么可能是条例中最好的元素;
What was probably the best element of the ordinance;

156
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:07,067
然而，它的条款是否规定两者都不是奴隶制
however, was its provision that neither slavery

157
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,533
也不是强制劳役
nor involuntary servitude

158
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:15,167
将永远存在于西北地区的土地上。
would ever exist in the lands of the northwest territory.

159
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,500
朋友是被领土吸引的
And Friends are drawn toward territories

160
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,600
奴隶制是非法的。
where slavery is illegal.

161
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,767
丹尼尔 · 布恩在宾夕法尼亚贵格会长大,
Daniel Boone, who grew up a pennsylvania Quaker,

162
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,400
是那些帮助朋友搬到西部的人之一

163
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:31,300
寻找一个安居乐业的地方。
in search of a place to live in peace and equality.

164
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,100
愿和平从她的天国降临,
Let peace, descending from her native heaven,

165
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,767
使她的橄榄在欢乐的民族中春天来临;
bid her olives spring amidst the joyful nations;

166
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,400
还有很多，和商业结盟,
and plenty, in league with commerce,

167
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,300
从她丰盛的手散布祝福！

丹尼尔 · 布恩，1784年。

00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,367
1799年，两个贵格会家庭
In 1799, two Quaker families

170
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,533
来自南卡罗莱纳州的布什河定居在“军事领地”
from bush river, south Carolina, settled on "Military Lands"

171
00:10:56,567 --> 00:11:00,267
在俄亥俄州西南部，华盛顿堡北部,
in southwestern Ohio, just north of fort Washington,

172
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,600
几年后,
the site of what would, in a few years,

173
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:06,367
成为辛辛那提繁荣的河港城市。
become the thriving river port town of Cincinnati.

174
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,267
1803年，更多迁徙的朋友加入了我们,
In 1803, joined by more migrating Friends,

175
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,200
他们建立了第一个正式承认的
they established the first formally recognized

176
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:18,267
贵格会教徒聚会做礼拜，或者叫做“教堂”
Quaker meeting for worship, or "church",

177
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
在俄亥俄州西南部:
in southwestern Ohio:

178
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:25,133
在韦恩斯维尔举行的迈阿密月会。
Miami monthly meeting in the village of Waynesville.

179
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,533
同一年，发生了一些事
And that same year, something was to happen

180
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,800
回到南卡罗来纳州的布什河
back in bush river, south Carolina

181
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,767
这将为贵格教徒的迁徙打开闸门
that would open the floodgates for Quaker migration

182
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,667
西北地区。
to the northwest territory.

183
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,167
撒迦利亚 · 迪克斯，贵格会教徒,
Zachariah Dix, a Quaker,

184
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,433
那些听到他讲话的人所描述的,
described by those who heard him speak,

185
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,500
“一个强有力的狂想传教士”
as "a powerful rhapsodical preacher"

186
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:47,700
“以不同寻常的程度预见未来”
with "prophetic insight in an unusual degree,"

187
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:50,400
传达了一个令人不安的信息。
delivered a disturbing message.

188
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:56,300
到了18世纪90年代，《老友记》开始相信
By the 1790s, Friends had come to believe

189
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,100
Zacharias 有预言的天赋。
that Zacharias had a gift of prophecy.

190
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:05,067
他能看穿人们的思想
That he could see into people's minds

191
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,433
了解他们隐秘的精神状态。
and understand what their secret spiritual states were.

192
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:15,267
他对未来有预兆。
And that he had foreshadowings of the future.

193
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,600
当朋友们记录他的讲道时
As friends recorded their memories of his preaching

194
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:24,433
几十年后，撒迦利亚对他们说的话
decades later, what Zacharias had to say to them

195
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:30,500
是这样的“你有祸了，灌木河。
was something like this, "Woe unto thee bush river.

196
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:34,033
你荣耀的花朵已经凋谢。
The flower of thy glory has faded.

197
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:38,133
滚出这埃及奴隶之地
Get thee, hence, out of this land of egyptian slavery

198
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:43,700
黑暗笼罩着西北的自由土地”
and darkness unto the free lands of the northwest."

199
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:49,267
几年之内，一个教友会团体,
And within a few years, a Quaker community that had numbered,

200
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,733
大概有近1000人,
probably close to 1000 people,

201
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:57,467
在南卡罗来纳州只剩下不到一百人。
was fewer than a hundred left in south Carolina.

202
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,600
来到中西部的贵格会教徒
The Quakers who came here to the midwest

203
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:04,533
是那些更喜欢冒险的人。
were those who were maybe more risk-takers.

204
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:07,167
他们离家出走,
They left homes,

205
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,767
建立良好的农场和村庄
well-established farms and villages

206
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,100
家庭搬回东部，搬到西部。
and families back east and moved west.

207
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:16,167
很多贵格会教徒留在了东部,
A lot of Quakers stayed on the east,

208
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,700
他们的农场和家庭所在的地方,
you know, where their farms and families were,

209
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,133
他们做得很好,
and they did good work there,

210
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,167
但是那些来到西部的人,
but the ones who came west,

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,433
冒着各种风险和机会,
took all sorts of risks and chances,

212
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:26,300
我突然想到，我们可能对他们知之甚少
and it strikes me, we may know less about them

213
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,533
因为他们是实干家而不是作家。
because they were doers more than writers.

214
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,267
他们没有必要坐下来写下他们做了什么,
They didn't necessarily sit and write down what they had done,

215
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
他们就在外面做这个。
they were out there just doing it.

216
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,767
大量的贵格会教徒继续迁徙
A large number of Quakers continued migrating

217
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,400
今天的印第安纳州和俄亥俄州就像那些来自布什河的人一样,
to present-day Indiana and Ohio just like those from bush river,

218
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:47,567
忠实地遵循他们内心之光的指引。
faithfully following guidance from their inner light.

219
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,700
无论贵格会教徒在哪里组成团体,
Quakers wherever they form communities,

220
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:53,633
首先形成了一个崇拜的集会。
first formed a meeting for worship.

221
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:57,000
接下来他们做的事情是为他们的孩子开办一所学校。
The next thing they did was to open a school for their children.

223
00:13:57,033 --> 00:14:02,300
那些贵格会学校经常招收非贵格会学生。
Those Quaker schools are often admitting non-Quaker students.

225
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:06,067
他们中的一些人获得了这样的名声
And some of them gained a reputation as being

226
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,800
中西部一些最好的中学。
some of the best secondary schools in the midwest.

227
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,167
1803年建州后,
After statehood in 1803,

228
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,600
建立了公立学校系统,
a public school system was set up,

229
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,767
但是黑人孩子不能参加。
but black children were not admitted to it.

230
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,433
尽管黑人地主被迫纳税
Even though black landowners were forced to pay taxes

231
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,667
资助公立学校,
that subsidized the public schools,

232
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,200
他们的孩子不能上那些学校。
their children could not attend those schools.

233
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:32,467
所以如果黑人孩子接受教育,
So if black children were to be educated,

234
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,633
也就是说他们的父母或者有同情心的白人
that means that their parents or sympathetic whites

235
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,533
必须让这一切成为可能。
had to make that possible.

236
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,100
在 Harveysburg
In Harveysburg,

237
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,133
离韦恩斯维尔只有几英里,
which is just a few miles from Waynesville,

238
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,133
那里有一个贵格会会议,
there was a Quaker meeting there,

239
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,700
有两个贵格会教徒,
and there were two Quakers,

240
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:50,467
elizabeth Harvey 和她丈夫。
Elizabeth Harvey and her husband.

241
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,100
他们在俄亥俄州为有色人种儿童创立了第一个,
They started the first for children of color in Ohio,

242
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:59,667
这在当时是闻所未闻的,
which was early and really unheard of at the time,

243
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:05,267
而且非常不满意，并且受到了很多人的批评
and highly frowned on and got a lot of criticism from people

244
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,733
他们不是朋友。
who weren't friends.

245
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:11,267
真正滋养自由的东西之一
One of the things that really feeds freedom

246
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,300
不是一个可以躲藏的地方而是一个可以学习的地方,
is not a place to hide but a place where you can learn,

247
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:21,033
一个你可以成为经济共同体的一部分的地方,
a place where you can become a part of the economic community,

248
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,400
为你的家人建造一个家,
build a home for your family,

249
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:25,133
然后把你的孩子送回学校。
and then send your children back to school.

250
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:30,367
哈维斯堡为黑人学生创办了一所学校
And Harveysburg created a school for black students

251
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,067
甚至雇佣黑人和白人教师。
and then even hire black and white teachers.

252
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,033
所以它很重要，因为它从基地开始。
And so it was important because it started at the base.

253
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,367
对于早期的朋友来说,
For early friends of course,

254
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,000
这只是普通的经文。
this is just plain scripture.

255
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,667
平等是..。
Equality is...

256
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,633
你看保罗的书信
you look in the epistle from Paul

257
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:55,167
上面说在基督里没有男女之分,
and it says in christ there is no male or female,

258
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,333
没有希腊人或犹太人，没有奴隶或自由。
there is no Greek or Jew, there is no slave or free.

259
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:06,200
如果我们是基督身体的一部分，我们都是一样的
If we are part of the body of christ, we are all the same

260
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,733
因此，社会的区别
and so the social distinctions that were made

261
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,033
并且仍然在一定程度上
and still are made to a degree

262
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,767
不同背景的人之间
between people of different backgrounds

263
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,767
还有不同的性别，这些都无关紧要。
and different genders, those are all irrelevant.

264
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,300
这些都是外在的东西，但内在的我们都是,
Those are all outward things, but internally we are all,

265
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,167
就像我说的，上帝的孩子们,
as I said, children of God,

266
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,733
都是上帝的子民。
and are all equally children of God.

267
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:29,567
随着越来越多的国家
As more and more of the country

268
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,633
开始依靠奴隶劳动来提高生产力和节约成本,
began relying upon slave labor for productivity and cost savings,

270
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:37,133
整个西北地区的贵格会教徒
Quakers throughout the northwest territory

271
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:40,467
继续做出艰难而危险的选择
continued to make the difficult and dangerous choice

272
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,700
支持所有人的自由。
of supporting freedom for all.

Christopher Anthony 贵格会的创始人之一

278
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:05,167
幸运的是，她有能力分享她的记忆
and fortunately, she had the wherewithal to share her memories

279
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,333
以及她家族的一些口述历史
of the meeting house and some of the oral history of her family

280
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,733
以及他们是如何到达辛辛那提的。
and how they came to arrive in Cincinnati.

281
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,367
”家庭用品都是马车运来的

282
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,600
还有一个黑人家庭。
and with them a family of negroes.

283
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:21,600
这个人是祖父的一个奴隶的后代
The man was a descendant of a slave of grandfather's

284
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,800
在祖父加入朋友会之前,
before grandfather joined the Society of Friends,

285
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,467
那时他释放了所有的奴隶”。
at which time he set all his slaves free".

287

即使是贵格会教徒
Even for Quakers

288
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:35,033
生活在没有奴隶制的西北地区,
living in the slavery free northwest territory,

289
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:38,133
这是不可避免的
it was impossible to avoid being drawn into

290
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:42,567
我们国家历史上最具争议的辩论。
the most contentious debate in the history of our nation.

291

许多朋友把智慧和创造力结合在一起
Many Friends combined intellect and creativity

292
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,067
克服对他们争取和平与平等工作的反对意见。

Levi 和 Catherine Coffin 就是最好的例子

在十九世纪三四十年代,
In the 1830s and 1840s,

296
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:04,167
印第安纳州韦恩县的纽波特镇,
the town of newport in Wayne county, Indiana,

297
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,233
被认为是最激进的
had a reputation as being one of the most radical

298
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:11,733
美国的反奴隶制中心。
anti-slavery centers in the United States.

299
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:16,100
众所周知，数以百计的逃亡奴隶
It was widely known that hundreds of fugitive slaves

300
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,300
经过纽波特;
had passed through newport;

301
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,767
大部分都是通过棺材屋,
most of them through the Coffin home,

302
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,100
他估计,
and he estimated that,

303
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:27,167
我相信，在他们的一生中
I believe, in the course of their lives

304
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,033
从1826年到1865年，他们帮助了
from 1826 to 1865 they had aided somewhere between

305
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:35,667
两千三千名逃犯。
two and three thousand fugitives.

306
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,133
据他所知，他们中没有一个人
And to the best of his knowledge none of them

307
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:41,067
曾经被夺取并重新成为奴隶。
was ever seized and returned to slavery.

308
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,800
Levi Coffin 是个有效的导体
Levi Coffin was an effective conductor

309
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,533
在地下铁路上
on the underground railroad

310
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,533
不仅因为他是个坚定的废奴主义者,
not just because he was a committed abolitionist,

311
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:51,633
还因为他是一个聪明，坚定的废奴主义者。
but also because he was a smart, committed abolitionist.

312
00:18:51,667 --> 00:19:00,300
他知道如果俘虏奴隶的人入侵纽波特甚至他的家园,
He knew that if slave capturers invaded newport or even his home,

314
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,467
他们有法律的支持。
they would have the force of law behind them.

315
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,800
所以他想尽办法
And so he tried to think of ways

316
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,600
他也许能智取他们。
that he might be able to outwit them.

317
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:13,467
你可以在房子里看到三个例子。
and you can see three examples of that here at the house.

318
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,367
第一个是井，就在里面。
The first is the well, which is inside.

319
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,033
当然，那样会很方便。
And of course, that would have been convenient.

320
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:24,233
但它也有一个优势，那就是爱管闲事的邻居
But it also had the advantage that snoopy neighbors who might

321
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:29,367
没有同情心的人永远不会注意到
not be sympathetic would never be able to notice just how much

322
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,700
棺材里的水都是自己用的
water the coffins were drawing for their own use

323
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:38,033
或者他们可能带着的18个逃亡的奴隶,
or for the 18 fugitive slaves that they might have with them,

324
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,667
在任何给定的时间。
at any given time.

325
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,800
阁楼上有个藏身之处,
In the attic, there is a hiding place,

326
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:48,067
如果有必要，人们可以藏在那里。
one where people could have been concealed, if necessary.

327
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,233
他们还有一个假底马车,
they also have a false bottom wagon,

328
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,800
这是另一个有效的方法
which would have been another effective way

329
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,767
运送逃亡的奴隶。
to transport fugitive slaves.

330
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,767
他们会特别危险
They would have been particularly in danger

331
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,067
当他们在公路上的时候。
when they're on the open road.

332
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,233
所以如果你觉得抓奴隶的人可能会跟踪你,
So if you think that slave catchers may be on your trail,

333
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:09,533
假底旅行车是一个很好的方法
the false bottom wagon is an excellent way

334
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,500
运送一个寻求自由的人。
to transport a freedom seeker.

335
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,800
我认为，对我来说，这是一个很好的例子
I think, to me, it's a good example

336
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:17,100
将实用性与道德见证相结合。
of combining practicality with a moral witness.

337
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,033
他没有试图躲避警长。
He didn't try and hide from the sheriff.

338
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,100
他只是坦白了
He was just open about it

339
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:29,533
这才是真正的公民抗命。
and this is what real civil disobedience is about.

340
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,400
公民抗命说这条法律是错误的。
Civil disobedience is saying this law is wrong.

341
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,667
我不会跟着它走的
I am not going to follow it

342
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,633
在人们想抓你的时候抓你。
and doing it out where people can catch you if they want to.

343
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:44,033
他没有隐瞒自己不仅仅是个指挥家,
He didn't hide the fact that he was, not just a conductor,

344
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,400
在地下铁路上,
on the underground railroad,

345
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:47,600
当时他被描述为总统
he was described at that time as the president

346
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:48,500
地下铁路的一部分
of the underground railroad

347
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:53,200
他被公开这样描述。
and he was described that way publicly.

348
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,033
在他的回忆录里,
In his memoir,

349
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,467
levi Coffin 叙述了一段对话
Levi Coffin recounts a conversation

350
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,267
和一个不赞成的男人
with a man who disapproved

351
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,433
帮助奴隶逃离主人。
of his helping slaves escape from their masters.

352
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,700
我告诉他我小时候读过圣经,
I told him I had read in the bible when I was a boy,

353
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:08,500
让饥饿的人吃饱穿暖是正确的,
that it was right to feed the hungry and clothe the naked,

354
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,167
并照顾那些堕落于盗贼之中的人
and to minister to those who had fallen among thieves

355
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,100
受了伤,
and were wounded,

356
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,200
而是不分肤色
but that no distinction in regard to color

357
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,800
在圣经中提到过,
was mentioned in the good book,

358
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,167
所以根据它的教导
so in accordance with its teachings

359
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,767
我接待了这些逃犯，并照顾他们。
I had received these fugitives and cared for them.

360
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,100
然后我问: “朋友，我这样做对吗?”
I then asked: "Was I right, friend, in doing so?"

361
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:27,067
他犹豫不决，似乎不知如何回答。
He hesitated and seemed at a loss how to reply.

362
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,233
我接着说: “你的圣经读起来怎么样？
I continued: "How does thy bible read?

363
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,167
难道不像我说的那样吗?”
Was it not as I have said?"

364
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,233
“是的，他回答说，看起来是这样的。”
"Yes, he answered, it reads somehow so."

365
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:36,700
他显然想转移话题。
He evidently wished to change the subject.

366
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,600
~ Levi 棺材。
~ Levi Coffin.

367
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:42,567
除了帮助逃犯逃脱奴役,
In addition to helping fugitives escape from slavery,

368
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,333
棺材和其他废奴主义者试图破坏
Coffin and other abolitionists worked to undermine

369
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,267
它的经济基础,
its economic foundation,

370
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,033
买卖棉花、糖等产品
buying and selling products such as cotton and sugar

371
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:56,800
种植园雇佣自由劳动者而不是奴隶。
from plantations that hired free laborers instead of using slaves.

373
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:00,233
1846年，一群废奴主义者
In 1846, a group of abolitionists

374
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:04,067
决定建立免费劳务批发仓库
decided to establish a free labor wholesale warehouse

375
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,700
敦促 Levi Coffin 监督其运作。
in Cincinnati and urged Levi Coffin to oversee its operation.

377
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:11,600
春天 Levi 和 Catherine Coffin
in the spring, Levi and Catherine Coffin

378
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:14,133
从印第安纳州纽波特的家里搬出来
moved from their home in Newport, Indiana

379
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,233
去俄亥俄州的辛辛那提。
to Cincinnati, Ohio.

380
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:18,367
在辛辛那提的这些年里,
Throughout their years in Cincinnati,

381
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,100
棺材也帮助了那些寻求自由的人
the Coffins also helped those who sought freedom

382
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,800
通过提供教育机会,
by providing opportunities for education,

383
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:27,767
传授简单的技能，剥夺了那些被奴隶制压迫的人的权利。
teaching simple skills denied those oppressed by slavery.

384
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,467
像 Levi Coffin 这样的人
People like Levi Coffin

385
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,300
不仅给你提供了庇护所
not only provided you with shelter

386
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:36,667
但却给了你希望。
but then provided you with hope.

387
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,767
帮助黑人学习读写
In helping black people learn to read, write

388
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,333
在联合浸信会教堂的地下室里，那就是自由。
in the basement of union baptist church, that's freedom.

390
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,567
即使他们抓住你，把你带回去
And even if they catch you and take you back

391
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,500
他们不再拥有你了。
they don't own you anymore.

392
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:54,767
科芬和其他像他一样的人明白，身体上的自由
Coffin and other people like him understood that physical freedom

393
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,633
没有工作，没有办法照顾家人
with no job and no way to take care of your family

394
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,300
只是另一种形式的奴隶制。
is just another form of slavery.

395
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,567
另一个辛辛那提的朋友
Another Cincinnati friend

396
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,633
他们对反对奴隶制的证词特别在意
who took the testimony against slavery particularly to heart

397
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,133
是 Mordecai Morris White。
was mordecai morris white.

398
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:11,300
他的外祖父是个富有的种植园主,
His maternal grandfather was a wealthy plantation owner,

399
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:16,500
1846年，当莫里斯 · 怀特只有16岁时,
and in 1846, when Morris White was only 16 years old,

400
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:19,633
他从祖父那里继承了一大笔遗产,
he inherited a large estate from his grandfather,

401
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:22,800
包括一些奴隶。
including a number of slaves.

402
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,733
在他二十出头的时候
When he was in his early twenties

403
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:29,800
作为一个年轻的商人住在辛辛那提,
and living in Cincinnati as a young businessman,

404
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:34,467
意识到自己是个奴隶主开始困扰他,
the realization that he was a slave owner began to bother him,

405
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,500
所以他骑马旅行
so he made the journey on horseback

406
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:42,100
一直到北卡罗来纳州,
all the way down to North Carolina,

407
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:43,300
登记他的奴隶
registered his slaves

408
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:48,367
确立他的所有权和解放他们的能力,
to establish his ownership and his ability to free them,

409
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,567
然后凌晨三点开始旅行
and then at three in the morning started on a journey

410
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,567
回到中西部。
back to the midwest.

411
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:02,633
当他到达诺福克时，有人给了他一万美元的黄金
When he got to Norfolk, he was offered $10,000 in gold

412
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:07,300
为他的奴隶团伙，并拒绝了它。
for his gang of slaves, and turned it down.

413
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:11,533
个人财产价值
The personal property value

414
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:16,600
南方六百万奴隶中的一部分更值钱
of the six million slaves in the south was worth more money

416
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:20,767
比北方所有的工厂和库存都多。
than all the factories and inventory of everything up north.

418
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,300
所以，当你要求把它拿走，送给别人的时候,
And so, when you ask that that be taken away and given away,

419
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,500
那就像告诉宝洁公司
that would be like telling procter & gamble

420
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:32,133
把他们所有的肥皂都送出去。
to give away all their soap.

421
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:35,467
我们没有意识到它的价值
We don't realize how much value there was

422
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,367
我们根本不知道那是什么感觉
and we don't have any idea of what it was like

423
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,100
有勇气逃跑。
to have the courage to run away.

424
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:45,300
最终末底改怀特的小组成功了
Eventually Mordecai White's group made its way

425
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,500
到 Raysville 的贵格会教徒定居点
to Raysville, Indiana, a settlement of Quakers

426
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:52,100
白人有亲戚的自由有色人种。
and free people of color where white had relatives.

427
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:55,067
在那里，怀特租了两套房子，并装修了家具
There, White rented and furnished two houses

428
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,633
为他以前的奴隶找工作，为砍柴的人找工作,
for his former slaves, and found jobs for the men chopping wood,

429
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:01,367
制造围栏和其他工作
making fencing rails, and other employment

430
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,600
让他们能够自给自足。
that would allow them to provide for themselves.

431
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:07,633
让你的生活说出你所相信的是一种冒险。
It's a risk to let your life speak what you believe.

432
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:10,133
所以不管你说你相信什么,
So it doesn't matter what you say you believe,

433
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:15,233
如果你的行为表现出不同的信仰，那就没关系了。
if your actions are showing a different belief, then it doesn't matter.

435
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:18,633
但这是有风险的。
But it is risky.

436
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,733
没有直接保护
Quakers who did not directly protect

437
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:24,233
引导奴隶通过地下铁路获得自由
and guide slaves to freedom on the underground railroad

438
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:27,333
找到了其他的方法，比如辛辛那提的朋友,
found other ways to contribute, such as cincinnati friend,

439
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:32,367
阿基里斯 · 皮尤和克林顿郡贵格会教徒，艾萨克和莎拉 · 哈维。
achilles pugh and clinton county Quakers, Isaac and Sarah Harvey.

441
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Pugh 拥有一家印刷公司
Pugh owned a printing company

442
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:38,133
出版了《慈善家》
that published, "The Philanthropist"

443
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:41,067
是詹姆斯 · 伯尼写的。
that was written by James Birney.

444
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:50,133
伯尼就像利瓦伊・科芬和来自里普利的约翰・兰金。
Birney was like Levi Coffin and like John Rankin from Ripley.

445
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:53,600
伯尼是个南方人,
And that Birney was a southerner,

446
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:58,800
伯尼是肯塔基州丹维尔一个奴隶主的儿子
Birney was the son of a slave owner from Danville, Kentucky

447
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:03,100
谁说这是不对的。
who said this isn't right.

448
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:05,467
这就是一个享有特权的人
And so here is a guy of privilege

449
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,033
有很强的道德基础
who has a strong moral base

450
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,233
却对财富视而不见
and just turns his back on wealth

451
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:13,267
然后开始写论文,
and started writing this paper,

452
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,700
辛辛那提的一些市民烧了他的报纸两次
and some of the citizens of Cincinnati burned his press twice

454
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:20,433
然后扔到了俄亥俄河里。
and dumped it here in the ohio river.

455
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,133
更糟的是他们决定离开
What's worse they decided to go

456
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:25,500
阿基里斯・皮尤的家
to achilles pugh's house that night

457
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,600
确保他没有
to make sure that he didn't have

458
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,667
更多的印刷设备。
any more printing equipment handy.

459
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,633
那一定是一段可怕的经历,
And it had to have been a terrifying experience,

460
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:40,067
让这群愤怒的暴民站在你家门口,
to have this angry mob at your front door step,

461
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,567
你的妻子和孩子都在你家里。
with your wife and your children there in your home.

462
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,033
幸运的是他们没有使用暴力。
Fortunately they didn't commit any violence.

463
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:50,700
他可以对自己说,
And he could have said to himself,

464
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:52,200
“这太危险了。
"This is too dangerous.

465
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:54,533
我不会再这么做了。”
I am not going to do this anymore."

466
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:58,133
相反，他去了他的印刷机,
Instead he went to his printing press,

467
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,600
把碎片捡起来,
literally picked up the pieces,

468
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:04,033
继续出版慈善家的作品。
and continuing publishing the philanthropist.

469
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,133
有些人就是典型的例子
There are certain individuals who exemplify

470
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:13,267
成为贵格会教徒意味着什么,
what it means to be a Quaker,

471
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,500
以及它从一开始就意味着什么,
and what it has meant from the beginning,

472
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,367
其中一个品质就是一定程度的忠诚
and one of the qualities is a degree of faithfulness

473
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,167
去领导，去沟通
to leading, to communicating

474
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,500
或者与上帝沟通，倾听。
or being communicated with God and listening.

475
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:33,767
Isaac 和 Sarah Harvey 就是一个很好的例子。
And Isaac and Sarah Harvey are a good example of that.

476
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,433
1862年夏末,
In the late summer of 1862,

477
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:43,567
他正在耕地
he was plowing in his field

478
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,200
你能想象走在马和犁的后面
and can you imagine walking behind horses and a plow

479
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:51,700
那一定是一种非常沉思的体验，你知道。
and that must be a very meditative kind of experience, you know.

481
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:56,800
他这么做的时候听到一个声音说,
So he was doing this and he heard a voice that said,

482
00:27:56,833 --> 00:28:01,333
“去华盛顿和总统谈谈”
"Go to washington and talk to the president."

483
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,800
他说，我不..
And he said, I don't --

484
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:07,233
他不知道声音是在外面还是在里面
he didn't know whether the voice was outside or inside

485
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:10,500
但他说“我听到了”
but he said, "I hear you."

486
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:15,467
于是他放下马，照顾他的马,
So he unhitched his horse and took care of his horses,

487
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,267
他回到家里对妻子莎拉说,
went to the house and said to his wife Sarah,

488
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,733
“你愿意和我一起去华盛顿见总统吗?”
"Will you go to washington with me to see the president?"

489
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:27,633
她用贵格会教徒的方式说: “谁派你来的?”
And she in her Quaker way says, "Who sends thee?"

490
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,467
他说“上帝”
And he says, "The Lord."

491
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,367
所以她当然准备好跟他走了，他们也这么做了。
So of course she's ready to go with him and they do.

492
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,333
内战正在进行
The civil war was underway

493
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,633
整个国家分崩离析,
and the country was divided and devastated,

494
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,267
战争和奴隶制。
by both war and slavery.

495
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,167
但艾萨克 · 哈维相信
But Isaac Harvey was convinced

496
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,167
上帝给了他一个信息让他分享
God had given him a message to share

497
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,167
也许能找到解决办法。
that might provide the solution.

498
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,233
莎拉和艾萨克 · 哈维在华盛顿特区下了火车。
So Sarah and Isaac Harvey get off the train in Washington DC.

500
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,567
他们不了解这个城市;
They don't know the city;

501
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,667
他们对此一无所知。
they don't know anything about it.

502
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,900
他们看着街对面,
They look across the street,

503
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:02,567
有一个人站在路灯旁边。
and there is a fellow standing over there by a street lamp.

504
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,733
于是他们走过去问他去白宫的路;
So they go over to him and ask directions to the white house;

505
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,033
他们是来见总统的。
they have come to see the president.

506
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,567
所以他问了他们几个问题
So he asks them a few questions

507
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,100
原来他是财政部长,
and it turns out that he is secretary of the treasury,

508
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,533
鲑鱼 P 蔡斯。
Salmon P. Chase.

509
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:16,633
他来自辛辛那提
He is from Cincinnati;

510
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:19,300
他曾在几个不同的政治机构任职,
he had served several different political offices,

511
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,467
包括俄亥俄州州长。
including governor of Ohio.

512
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,667
当他发现他们来自威尔明顿
When he finds out they are from Wilmington,

513
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,133
他知道他们是贵格会教徒，他了解这个地区,
and he knows they're Quakers, and he knows the area,

514
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:30,267
他带着他们，他说，“跟我来，我会让你安顿下来。”
he takes them, he says, "Come with me; I will get you settled."

516
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,767
他把他们带到寄宿公寓之类的地方,
He takes them to a boarding house or something,

517
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,233
给他们找了个房间,
and finds them a room,

518
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,700
他和他们约好了见面时间
and he sets up an appointment with them

519
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,200
去见亚伯拉罕 · 林肯。
to go see Abraham Lincoln.

520
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,433
所以他们去了候诊室
So they went into the waiting room

521
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:43,033
许多人在读报纸
and many people reading the newspaper

522
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:46,133
因为安提塔姆之战刚刚被打败
because the battle of antietam had just been fought

523
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,700
北方赢了
and the north had won

524
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:50,233
但是伤亡惨重。
but there had many, many causalities.

525
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:53,600
所以他们等待着，认为他们肯定会
So they waited thinking certainly they would probably

526
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:57,300
永远不要介入这些重要的事情。
never get in with all these important things going on.

527
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:02,067
但在他们指定的时间，林肯总统召集了他们
But at their appointed time, president Lincoln called them in

528
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,200
他们报告说林肯总统拿起了他的椅子
and they reported that president Lincoln picked up his chair

529
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,733
过来坐在他们中间
and came over and sat between them

530
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:12,633
这样他就可以和他们私下谈谈。
so that he could talk to them more personally.

531
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:17,267
他们聊了半个小时
So they talk for about half an hour

532
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,800
在那之后
and at the end of that time

533
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:23,367
林肯总统签署了一份声明
president Lincoln signed a note

534
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,133
说他们去拜访过他,
saying that they had visited with him,

535
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:31,200
他们安慰了他，并和他约会。
that they had comforted him and dated it.

536
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,600
我很高兴地宣称
I take pleasure in asserting that I have had

537
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:37,100
与朋友艾萨克 · 哈维有利可图的性交
profitable intercourse with friend Isaac Harvey

538
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:39,433
还有他的好妻子莎拉 · 哈维。
and his good wife Sarah Harvey.

539
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:43,367
愿主安慰他们，就像他们支持我一样。
May the Lord comfort them as they have sustained me.

540
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,100
~ Abraham Lincoln-September 19,1862亚伯拉罕 · 林肯 -1862年9月19日。
~ Abraham Lincoln - September 19, 1862.

541
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:52,100
哈维来访两天后,
About two days after the Harvey visit,

542
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,633
第一份草稿
the first draft of what would become

543
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:58,133
解放奴隶宣言交给了国会。
the emancipation proclamation was given to the congress.

544
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:59,733
在这个初步版本中
In this preliminary version

545
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:03,067
林肯在他的第二段中提到
Lincoln includes in his second paragraph

546
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,300
几乎和艾萨克 · 哈维的建议一模一样,
almost exactly what Isaac Harvey had suggested,

547
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,367
那就是政府,
and that is that the government,

548
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,767
美国政府从南方购买奴隶。
the US government purchase slaves from the south.

549
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:19,300
1862年9月22日，林肯发表了如下声明:
On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the following:

550
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,367
”这是我的使命,
"That it is my purpose,

551
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,333
在下一次国会会议上
upon the next meeting of congress

552
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:26,767
再次建议采取切实可行的措施
to again recommend the adoption of a practical measure

553
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,300
对自由接受提供金钱援助
tendering pecuniary aid to the free acceptance

554
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:33,433
或是否决所有的奴隶制国家，所谓的,
or rejection of all slave states, so called,

555
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:36,267
那些不会造反的人
the people whereof may not then be in rebellion

556
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,033
反对美国和哪个国家
against the united states and which states

557
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:41,367
可能会自愿领养,
may then have voluntarily adopted,

558
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,033
或其后可自愿领养,
or thereafter may voluntarily adopt,

559
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:47,333
立即或逐步废除奴隶制
immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery

560
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,300
在各自的限度内”。
within their respective limits".

561
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,367
还有发生的美妙的事情
And the wonderful thing that happens

562
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,267
当你这么忠诚的时候,
when you are faithful like that,

563
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,667
你有能力做一些事情
is that you are able to do things

564
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,267
你不应该做的事。
you shouldn't be able to do.

565
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
你不应该刚到,
You shouldn't be able to just arrive,

566
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,067
在华盛顿特区下车
get off the train in Washington DC

567
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,400
去见林肯总统。
and make your way to see president Lincoln.

568
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:08,467
当你有这种自信的时候,
And when you have that kind of confidence,

569
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,600
你并不孤单，你可以..。
you are not alone and you can...

570
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:12,600
你完成了不可思议的事情,
you accomplish incredible things,

571
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:16,633
还有乔治 · 福克斯的这个想法
and that's along with this idea of George Fox

572
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:20,067
当他说“让你的生命如此传道”
when he said "Let your life so preach."

573
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,400
换句话说，你的生活，你的所作所为,
In other words, your life will-- what you do,

574
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:25,567
如果你是忠实的，并调整和聆听
if you are faithful and tuned in and listening

575
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,267
然后付诸行动,
and you act on them,

576
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,433
你的生命会说出你所相信的。
your life will speak what you believe.

577
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:34,533
所以看到一个人坚守信仰是一个强有力的信息
So it's a powerful message to watch someone live a faith

578
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,367
而不是说出来。
and not just say it.

580
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,100
从17世纪开始
Since the 17th century

581
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:56,667
贵格会的官方立场是所有的战争和战斗
the official Quaker position has been that all wars and fighting

582
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,433
违背了上帝的旨意
are contrary to the will of God

583
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:05,533
作为忠诚的基督徒，朋友永远不能携带武器
and that friends as faithful christians, can never bear arms

584
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:09,600
剥夺人类同胞的生命,
to deprive fellow human beings of their lives,

585
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,500
即使是正当防卫。
even in self-defense.

586
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,667
内战是不同的。
The civil war is different.

587
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,300
他们看到了联盟
They see the confederacy

588
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:19,033
致力于保卫奴隶制
as committed to the defense of slavery

589
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,267
在贵格会教徒看来,
and that, in Quaker minds,

590
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,667
让它变得绝对不道德，无法辩护。
makes it absolutely immoral, indefensible.

591
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,400
这就是朋友们面临的选择。
So, that's the choice that friends are facing.

592
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:34,233
如果我们真的接受并相信
If we truly accept and believe that there is indeed

593
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:38,267
那么我们必须成为一个和平使者。
that of God in every person, then we must be a peacemaker.

594
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,133
我们必须给予每个人充分的正义和平等
We must give full justice and equality to every person

595
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:49,167
寻求世界所需的和平与正义
and seek the peace and justice that the world needs

596
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,600
灵魂需要我们。
and that the spirit requires of us.

597
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:55,467
正如国家分裂一样，贵格会也是如此。
Just as the country was divided, so were Quakers.

598
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,167
在对奴隶制的憎恶中挣扎
Torn between their abhorrence of slavery

599
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,733
以及他们和平的见证,

600
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:03,733
一些年轻的贵格会教徒加入了联邦军队。

选择不参与暴力;
elected not to participate in violence;

603
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:10,200
因此他们被贴上懦夫的标签

604
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:14,667
面对全社会的嘲笑和羞辱。

虽然贵格会教徒不愿意为了他们的原则而杀人,
Although Quakers were not willing to kill for their principles,

607
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:23,167
他们愿意受苦，甚至愿意为他们而死。

以德报怨，爱护敌人。

他们的行为必须继续遵循同样的原则。
their conduct must continue to be guided by the same principles.

619
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:57,233
如果侵略者的剑被举起来对抗他们,

620
00:34:57,267 --> 00:35:01,633
戒律仍然在手，他们抵抗不邪恶。

621

他们仍然被禁止为自己复仇,

仍然被命令为迫害他们的人祈祷。

如果他们被一群敌人包围,
If they are surrounded by a host of enemies,

626
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:16,667
无论那些敌人多么暴力和恶毒,
however violent and malicious those enemies may be,

627
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:23,633
基督教的爱必须仍然是不间断的，仍然是普遍的。
christian love must still be unbroken, still universal.

628
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,533
在承受口头攻击的同时

00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:28,433
有时是肉体上的迫害,

00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:33,433
朋友们找到了在避免暴力的同时提供解决方案的方法。

00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:45,233
如果你看看制服
ruth: if you look at the uniforms

884
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:50,200
他们看起来和制服一模一样
they looked exactly like the uniforms

885
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:53,500
美国军队在那次冲突中所穿的,
that the american military were wearing in that conflict,

886
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:56,100
那是因为他们实际上是在购买
and that was because they were actually buying

887
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:58,800
多余的军装,
surplus army uniforms,

888
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:02,733
让这些年轻人穿上这个。
and outfitting these young men in this.

889
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:07,167
所以当你看到他们袖子上的制服
so when you see the uniforms they have on the sleeve

890
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,800
红色和黑色的星星，这是采用作为标志
the red and black star, which was adopted as the logo

891
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:13,767
为美国朋友服务委员会工作。
for the american friend service committee.

892
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,067
还有很多年轻的贵格会教徒
donne: and there were lot of young Quakers

893
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,500
和其他和平教会的成员，比如门诺派教徒
and other members of peace churches like the mennonite

894
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:23,667
还有那些不想去打仗的弟兄们的教堂。
and the church of the brethren who did not want to go fight.

895
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,433
他们愿意服役，他们愿意牺牲,
they were willing to serve, they were willing to die,

896
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:30,200
但他们没有，他们不能杀人。
but they didn't, they couldn't kill.

897
00:50:30,233 --> 00:50:33,367
所以当法国还有炸弹落下的时候,
so while there were bombs still falling in france,

898
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,133
美国贵格会和英国贵格会
american Quakers and british Quakers

899
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,133
正在重建农舍
were rebuilding farmhouses

900
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:42,700
帮助那些整个城镇都被摧毁的人们。
and helping the people whose whole towns had been destroyed.

901
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:45,167
贵格会教徒进去重建家园,
Quakers went in there and were rebuilding,

902
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,133
即使破坏仍在发生。
even as the destruction was still happening.

903
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:49,667
那些忠诚的成员之一
narrator: one of those devoted members

904
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,267
美国朋友服务委员会的成员
of the american friends service committee

905
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,200
是俄亥俄州 Wilmington 市人 Luther Warren。
was wilmington, ohio native, luther warren.

906
00:50:56,233 --> 00:51:00,500
Luther Warren 讲述了一个震撼人心的故事
ruth: luther warren tells this amazing powerful story

907
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:03,667
和这个法国家庭共度一天
about spending the day with this french family

908
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,600
此时此刻，这个家族仅剩的一切
and at this point, all that is left of this family

909
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:10,567
是奶奶，妈妈和一个小女孩,
is grandma, mom, and a little girl,

910
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,267
所以卢瑟和他的几个合伙人
and so luther and a couple of his partners

911
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,567
一起为这个家庭建造这个家。
are working together to build this home for this family.

912
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,367
他们很感激有这个家,
they are so grateful to have this home,

913
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,167
让他们有地方住。
to have a roof over their heads again.

914
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,067
卢瑟和他的人回营地去了
luther and the men leave to go back to their camp

915
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,667
明天一早就知道
and find out first thing in the morning

916
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,600
战线已经转移
that the battle lines have shifted

917
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:32,267
所以他们必须回到同一个家庭
and so they have to go back to this same family

918
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,233
把他们从他们刚建的房子里赶出去。
and evacuate them from this home that they just built.

919
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:41,300
这个故事真正让人惊叹的是卢瑟 · 沃伦,
what's really amazing about this story is luther warren,

920
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:44,367
maynard McKay Mark McMillan
maynard mckay, mark mcmillan

921
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,167
这里所有的年轻人
all of these young men from this area

922
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,700
首先，他们有这些文化体验
they're having, first of all, these cultural experiences

923
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,700
俄亥俄州西南部的农场男孩
that farm boys from southwest ohio

924
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:58,500
从来没有过。
have never had before.

925
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:01,367
但想想这需要多大的勇气,
but to think about the courage that it took,

926
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,067
说“不，我不相信那是什么东西”
to say "no, I don't believe that that is something

927
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,267
”我可以参与其中
"that I can participate in

928
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,233
因此，我将选择这么做。”
and so this is what I am going to choose to do instead."

929
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:12,233
然后才知道他们也处于同样的危险之中
and then to know that they were in just as much danger

930
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:17,233
那个拿着步枪的年轻人。
as the young man who were carrying rifles.

931
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,167
有些人是医护人员
neil: some of them worked as medics

932
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,067
或者在医院里，或者在其他地方,
or in the hospitals, that and other functions,

933
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,100
而是医院的工作，这在难民工作中很常见
but hospital work, and this was common to work with refugees

934
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:29,533
孩子和年轻母亲,
and children and young mothers,

935
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:33,500
专注于那种解脱。
a kind of focus on that kind of relief.

936
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:37,267
我喜欢这样的组合: 尝试做出改变
I like this combination: trying to make changes

937
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,700
将产生长期和广泛的影响
that will have long term and broad effects

938
00:52:40,733 --> 00:52:43,700
美国朋友服务委员会已经这么做了。
the american friend service committee has done that.

939
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:46,300
根据华莱士 · T · 科莱特的说法,
narrator: according to wallace t. collett,

940
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,467
他是主席
who served as chairman

941
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,167
在1970年代的美国朋友服务委员会,
of the american friends service committee in the 1970s,

942
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,167
1917年的组织者
its organizers in 1917

943
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,500
受到 William Penn 的一句名言的启发:
were inspired by a quotation from william penn:

944
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,767
那就让我们试试爱的力量
william: let us then try what love will do;

945
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,133
因为如果男人看到我们爱他们,
for if men did once see we love them,

946
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:05,467
我们很快就会发现他们不会伤害我们。
we should soon find they would not harm us.

947
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:10,800
尽管大战在1918年结束,
narrator: though the great war came to a close in 1918,

948
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:15,367
美国朋友服务委员会的工作仍在继续。
the work of the american friends service committee continued.

949
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,767
每天大约有一百万个孩子
ruth: something close to a million children a day

950
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,600
很多年来,
for a number of years,

951
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:23,767
在欧洲的救援工作。
were being fed by this relief work in europe.

952
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,700
这项工作有一个强大的遗产
that work had a powerful legacy

953
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:30,067
因为他们不仅喂养法国孩子,
because they weren't just feeding french children,

954
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,800
他们也在喂养德国的孩子。
they were feeding german children as well.

955
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,033
他们喂养任何需要被喂养的人。
they were feeding anyone who needed to be fed.

956
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:40,767
有一个叫乔 · 沃克的人,
there is a man named joe volk, who, for a number of years,

957
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,467
是执行秘书
was the executive secretary

958
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,767
朋友的国家立法委员会。
of the friend's committee on national legislation.

959
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,100
二十世纪七八十年代他在德国旅行,
in the 1970s and 1980s he was traveling in germany,

960
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:53,133
他们在研究东西方关系
and they were working on east-west relations

961
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:56,067
和反核武器工作,
and anti-nuclear weapons work,

962
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,467
但是他正在和一些官员谈话
but he was talking with some officials

963
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,600
德国政府的高层。
high up in the german government.

964
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:06,400
在某种程度上，我个人对此感到非常惊讶
and at some point was just kind of really personally amazed

965
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:09,533
这些人是如此的愿意和开放
that these people were so willing and open

966
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:10,800
和他谈谈,
to talk with him,

967
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:14,200
当他们不愿意和别人交谈的时候
when they weren't willing and open to talk with other people

968
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:17,267
最后他问了一个人，这是什么？
and so he finally asked somebody, what is it?

969
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,667
why me?
why us?
why me?
why us?

970
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,933
为什么是美国朋友服务委员会？
why the american friend service committee?

971
00:54:19,967 --> 00:54:23,633
为什么你和我们说话，却不和其他人说话？
why are you talking to us and you wont talk to anyone else?

972
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:27,267
这个德国官员说，因为我不会在这里
and this german official said because I wouldn't be here

973
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,667
如果你没有喂饱我的父母。
if you hadn't fed my parents.

974
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,467
所以我们说的是一代人之后，对吧,
and so we are talking about a generation after, right,

975
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,233
这家伙的父母是贵格会教徒养大的
this guy's parents had been fed by Quakers

976
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:42,133
在第一次世界大战后的几年里。
in the years after world war i.

977
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:46,200
所以我们想了很多，听了很多关于涟漪效应的事
so we think a lot and we hear a lot about the ripple effects

978
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:47,667
冲突结束后的冲突,
of conflict after the conflict is over,

979
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,400
而是考虑人道主义援助的涟漪效应
but to think about the ripple effects of humanitarian aid

980
00:54:51,433 --> 00:54:57,100
以及几代人之后的和平工作
and of peace work generations after that's happened

981
00:54:57,133 --> 00:55:01,600
我觉得这个故事讲得不够多。
and I think that's a story that doesn't get told enough.

982
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:14,467
[音乐]
[music]

983
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,767
到了1940年，很明显，另一个主要的冲突
narrator: by 1940, it was clear that another major conflict

984
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,567
正在欧洲酝酿。
was brewing in europe.

985
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:38,633
罗伯特 · 琼斯，辛辛那提朋友会部长,
robert jones, minister of cincinnati friends meeting,

986
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:42,033
参加了印第安纳州里士满的一个聚会,
attended a gathering in richmond, indiana,

987
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:44,667
正如他们所解释的,
"for the purpose of,"
as they explained,

988
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:49,367
“讨论在这个混乱的世界里朋友能做些什么”
"discussing what friends can do in this world of confusion."

989
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,533
他报告说美国朋友服务委员会
he reported that the american friends service committee

990
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:55,100
试图与政府合作,
was trying to work out, with the government,

991
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:58,767
为依良心拒服兵役者提供某种服务,
some sort of service for the conscientious objectors,

992
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,800
如果战争来临。
should war come.

993
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:04,533
其结果是“选择性培训和服务法案,
the result was "the selective training and service act,

994
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:09,400
其中包括豁免任何人参加战斗,
which, included an exemption from combat for any person "who,

995
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:12,267
因为宗教训练和信仰,
"by reason of religious training and belief,

996
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,800
”是出于良心反对的
"is conscientiously opposed

997
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:17,667
参与任何形式的战争”
to participation in war in any form."

998
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,433
第二次世界大战期间,
thomas: during world war ii,

999
00:56:19,467 --> 00:56:24,467
联邦法律限制了替代性服务
federal law restricted the alternative service

1000
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
出于良心拒服兵役者
of conscientious objectors

1001
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:29,667
美国境内的项目。
to projects within the united states.

1002
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,300
所以你看到了出于良心拒服兵役者

1003
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:38,067
他们在精神病院做护理员,

或者集中营的幸存者可以通过护理恢复健康。

1013
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:13,500
所以他们有自己的勇气。
so they were brave in their own way.

1014
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:15,333
几个来自中西部的贵格会教徒

二战结束时，美国朋友服务委员会

他从一个村庄走到另一个村庄,

1105
01:02:27,233 --> 01:02:29,233
如果有人在走路，他就会停下来接他
he would stop and pick up people if they were walking

1106
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:31,467
看起来他还有地方,
and it looked like he had room,

1107
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,633
所以他抱起了这个老人,
and so he picked up this elderly man,

1108
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,033
载他去了下一个村庄,
gave him a ride to the next village,

1109
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:39,267
老人从卡车旁边走进来问道,

1110
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,100
“我欠你多少钱?”
"how much do I owe you?"

1111
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:45,100
还有那个美国朋友服务委员会的家伙

1112
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:47,200
说: “没什么，这是我们的工作;

1113
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:49,100
你知道，我们是来帮忙的。”

1114
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:52,200
老人抬头一看，看到了贵格会的徽章,
and the old man glanced up and he saw the Quakers insignia,

1115
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:56,600
他说，“啊，贵格会教徒，这就解释了一切。”
and he said, "ah, Quakers, that explains everything."

1116
01:02:56,633 --> 01:02:58,300
是因为
that was left over because

1117
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:01,433
他们记得贵格会在一战中的所作所为。
they remembered what Quakers had done in world war i.

1118
01:03:01,467 --> 01:03:06,400
这让我想起了 William Penn 的一句话,
and that makes me think about that saying from william penn,

1119
01:03:06,433 --> 01:03:08,800
“让我们尝试爱的力量”
"let us then try what love will do,"

1120
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:15,633
我认为爱是在一战期间和战后自由给予的
and I think love given freely during and after world war i

1121
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,667
在50年和60年后被人们记住

and had an impact 50 or 60 years later on your enemies.

1123
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:26,733
我的意思是，这是一个非常有力的教训,
I mean that's such a powerful lesson,

1124
01:03:26,767 --> 01:03:33,700
它给基督教的教义以信任和分量

1170
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,767
这就是为什么他们被称为厨房学校

1171
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,933
因为他们中的很多人,

或者我们可以说是反对战争。

我必须说，我认为我已经达到了我生命中的一个点

我觉得外面有很多人

也许会有某种感觉

1224
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,200
但它们没有捕捉到那种感觉
but they just don't capture that feeling

1225
01:09:24,233 --> 01:09:27,100
因为他们害怕别人会怎么想

他们不是，你知道，不是这么回事。

我公开宣布我不能,

吉姆: 警卫进入了围栏区
jim: the guard moved into the fenced in area

1267
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,733
发现自己被堵住了，动弹不得。
and found themselves blocked, couldn't move.

1268
01:11:40,767 --> 01:11:45,433
所以有那么一瞬间,
so there was a moment of back and forth between,

1269
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,767
我们大概有八到十个人，在停车场。

1270
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,100
国民警卫队会发射催泪瓦斯

1271
01:11:54,133 --> 01:11:59,300
我们顺利排除了催泪瓦斯

1272
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:02,100
捡起来扔回去。
and pick it up and throw it back.

1273
01:12:02,133 --> 01:12:09,033
然后我发现，我捡起了一块石头
and then I found myself-- I had picked up a rock

1274
01:12:09,067 --> 01:12:15,700
我发现我的胳膊翘起来准备扔这块石头
and I found my arm cocked ready to throw this rock

1275
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:22,400
时间静止了。
and time stood still.

1276
01:12:22,433 --> 01:12:31,167
宇宙消失了，我听到耶稣说,
the universe vanished and I heard jesus say,

1277
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,667
jim 你确定要这么做吗？
"jim are you sure you want to do that?

1278
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:38,733
放下石头，跟我来”
drop that rock and follow me."

1279
01:12:38,767 --> 01:12:43,500
所以我的战争出于道义原因而拒服兵役者
and so my conscientious objection to war

1280
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:48,100
基于耶稣教义的非暴力,

1281
01:12:48,133 --> 01:12:50,067
回到我身边，我把石头扔了。

collett 搬去了辛辛那提,

1287
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,167
在那里他成为了一个杰出的商人和市民领袖。

1288
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,433
并最终成为主席

1289
01:13:14,467 --> 01:13:18,167
美国朋友服务委员会的成员。
of the american friends service committee.

1290
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,733
Wallace 很坦率,
paul: wallace was upfront,

1291
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:24,800
公开反对战争税。
out in the open with his war tax resistance.

1292
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:28,567
每年他都会填写他的1040
every year he would fill out his 1040

1293
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:33,500
然后他会写下一张纸条
and he'd get to the bottom and he'd write a note

1294
01:13:33,533 --> 01:13:41,267
并附上它，告诉国税局，他没有支付 X 美元
and attach it, telling the irs that he had not paid x dollars

1295
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,233
因为他认为它们是美元
because he considered them to be dollars

1296
01:13:44,267 --> 01:13:48,800
支持军队。
that supported the military.

1297
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:52,767
但后来他继续说下去，他会告诉他们
but then he went on and he would tell them

1298
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,400
我存了那么多钱
"i have deposited that amount of money

1299
01:13:56,433 --> 01:14:00,533
加上10% 的罚金
"plus whatever you know
10% for the penalties

1300
01:14:00,567 --> 01:14:03,100
我知道你会评估的
"that I know you are going to assess

1301
01:14:03,133 --> 01:14:05,100
加上可能到期的利息。
"plus any interest that might be due.

1302
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:07,033
我把钱都存在这个银行账户里了。”
I put it all in this bank account."

1303
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:10,767
他会告诉他们银行名字和账号
he'd give them the bank name and the account number

1304
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,133
这样他们就能拿到钱了。
so they could go and get that money.

1305
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:15,133
所以他打算抵制税收。
so he was going to resist the taxes.

1306
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,600
他知道他们会想要的
he knew that they were going to want it

1307
01:14:17,633 --> 01:14:20,400
他不会阻止他们得到它。
and he wasn't gonna try to stop them from getting it.

1308
01:14:20,433 --> 01:14:24,533
事实上，他最终付出了更多，因为他知道他们
in fact he ended up paying more because he knew they were

1309
01:14:24,567 --> 01:14:27,067
评估罚款和利息。
going to assess penalties and interest on it.

1310
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,267
所有的钱都在银行里，但他做了别的事。
all that money was in the bank, but then he did something else.

1311
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,567
这才是精彩的部分。
this is the good part.

1312
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,767
他认识辛辛那提大部分银行的总裁,
he knew the presidents of most of the banks in cincinnati,

1313
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,533
也许是辛辛那提所有的银行。
maybe all the banks in cincinnati.

1314
01:14:39,567 --> 01:14:43,267
他会在银行开个账户，把钱存进去,
he would open an account at the bank, put the money in,

1315
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,100
然后他会预约
but then he'd make an appointment

1316
01:14:45,133 --> 01:14:48,367
和银行行长谈话
with the president of the bank

1317
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,733
他会走进去说“嗨 Al 你好吗?”？
and he would go in and he'd say, "hi al, how are you doing?

1318
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:53,300
很高兴见到你。
"it's good to see you.

1319
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:55,667
听着，国税局要来了
"listen the irs is going to come

1320
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,267
他们会没收我的账户。”
and they are going to seize my account."

1321
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:01,100
你可以想象这会引起多大的震惊。
well, you can imagine the shock that this would cause.

1322
01:15:01,133 --> 01:15:04,667
我的意思是，这是我们社区里的一个永久性的人
I mean, this is a permanent person in our community

1323
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,467
他以银行行长的身份告诉我
and he is telling me as the president of the bank

1324
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,267
他们会来没收他的财产。
that they are going to come and seize his assets.

1325
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,300
当然，作为总统我该怎么做？
and so of course what do I do as the president?

1326
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:16,800
我问你为什么，发生什么事了？
I said why, what's going on?

1327
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:20,733
Wallace 就有机会告诉他们
and wallace would then have the opportunity to tell them

1328
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:25,233
战争税代表了什么,
about what war taxes represented,

1329
01:15:25,267 --> 01:15:29,767
为什么他们错了，他做了什么来反抗他们。
why they were wrong and what he was doing to resist them.

1330
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:35,267
这让他有机会为杰出人士服务,
it gave him an opportunity to minister to prominent people,

1331
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:41,267
在商界有权有势的人
people with power and authority in the business community

1332
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:46,433
我只是觉得这是个很好的例子
and I just think that's just such a tremendous example

1333
01:15:46,467 --> 01:15:47,533
为了我们所有人。
for all of us.

1334
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,200
这些年来，其他人喜欢 Jim Crocker-lakness
narrator: over the years, others like jim crocker-lakness

1335
01:15:52,233 --> 01:15:56,300
面临着与和平证词有关的艰难抉择。
faced difficult choices related to the peace testimony.

1336
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:59,400
Ryan Myers 的情况就是这样
such was the situation of ryan myers

1337
01:15:59,433 --> 01:16:02,600
在1990年的沙漠风暴中。
during desert storm in 1990.

1338
01:16:02,633 --> 01:16:05,367
但是在朋友的指导下
but after some guidance from fellow friend

1339
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,533
以及出于良心拒服兵役者，查理・皮尔森,
and conscientious objector, charlie pierson,

1340
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:12,633
迈尔斯对自己的决定更有信心。
myers was more confident in his decision.

1341
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:15,433
考虑到要注册选择性服务,
ryan: looking at having to register for selective service,

1342
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:17,233
我不会这么做的。
that I was not going to.

1343
01:16:17,267 --> 01:16:21,167
Charlie Pearson 也是会议成员之一
so charlie pearson, who was a member of the meeting

1344
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,200
二战期间我是个狱警,
I was a co during wwii,

1345
01:16:24,233 --> 01:16:27,300
是我小时候的导师。
was a bit of mentor for me when I was young.

1346
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,500
我想我从中获得了力量
I think I took some strength from that

1347
01:16:29,533 --> 01:16:33,600
我了解 Charlie 我尊重 Charlie。
knowing that, okay I know charlie and I respect charlie.

1348
01:16:33,633 --> 01:16:36,367
他做到了，他没事。
he was able to do it, he was okay.

1349
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,333
当然，在我做决定的时候
of course, when I was making the decision

1350
01:16:39,367 --> 01:16:42,733
我知道这会带来潜在的法律后果。
I knew it carried potential legal consequences.

1351
01:16:42,767 --> 01:16:45,800
可能会被处以巨额罚款,
the possibility of a pretty substantial fine,

1352
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:50,533
坐牢，而且我没有资格申请助学贷款。
prison time, and i'm not eligible for student loans.

1353
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:53,267
但我觉得这对我来说是正确的决定。
but I think it was the right decision for me.

1354
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,033
我想如果情况相同的话
I think if the circumstances were the same

1355
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:56,567
我会再做一次决定。
i'd make the decision again.

1356
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:08,200
[音乐]
[music]

1357
01:17:08,233 --> 01:17:10,667
近年来，一些贵格会教徒,
narrator: in recent years, some Quakers have,

1358
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,433
就像他们的前辈一样,
as their predecessors did,

1359
01:17:12,467 --> 01:17:17,067
重点关注提供教育平等的项目。
focused on projects to provide education equality.

1360
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:20,067
在当地朋友会议的支持下,
with the support of her local friends meeting,

1361
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,800
辛辛那提贵格会教徒 Cathy Barney 把她的精力
cincinnati Quaker cathy barney has put her energy

1362
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:28,567
进入一个为贫困儿童设立的艺术项目。
into an arts program for underprivileged children.

1363
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,567
我开始是因为我知道有孩子
cathy: I started it because I just knew that there were kids

1364
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,600
在我家附近
in my neighborhood

1365
01:17:34,633 --> 01:17:36,567
没有选择和机会
that didn't have the options and opportunities

1366
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,433
普通孩子都有的,
that the average kid has,

1367
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:40,633
但这些孩子同样有价值。
yet these kids were just as valuable.

1368
01:17:40,667 --> 01:17:44,600
我希望为这些孩子提供一个安全的地方,
I hope to provide a safe place for these kids,

1369
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:47,300
我希望这能激发他们的灵感。
I hope it sparks something in them.

1370
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:50,467
也许会有一个领域或者机会出现
that maybe an area or opportunity would open up

1371
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,133
他们以前从未见过的东西。
that they hadn't seen before.

1372
01:17:54,467 --> 01:17:56,767
这只是一种发挥创造力的方式
donovan: it's just a way to be creative

1373
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,533
把手弄脏。
and get your hands dirty.

1374
01:18:00,567 --> 01:18:04,433
我们画了些东西，还买了顶帽子
mckenzee: we painted stuff and we got like one of those hats

1375
01:18:04,467 --> 01:18:08,033
艺术家穿的衣服。
that the artists wear.

1376
01:18:08,067 --> 01:18:09,667
有些孩子告诉我
cathy: some of the kids have told me

1377
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,667
他们真的很喜欢来这里，因为这能让他们
they really like to come here because it gets them

1378
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:13,767
远离他们生活的日常生活。
away from the daily drama where they live.

1379
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:19,133
我一直回来，因为有时候
angel: I keep coming back because sometimes

1380
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:22,633
当我心情不好的时候，这是我唯一能去的地方
when I like have a bad day, this is the only place I can go to

1381
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:26,300
让我感觉好多了。
and it like makes me feel better about myself.

1382
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:30,567
我想 Cathy 想 Pat 他们都在教我
I miss cathy and miss pat and all of them teaching me

1383
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,600
生活中重要的责任和事情。
the important responsibilities and stuff in life.

1384
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:38,167
我认为这真的给了他们一种声音，一种自我表达。
cathy: I think it really gives them a voice, self expression.

1385
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,667
如果这些孩子有自我表达的场所
if these kids have a venue for self expression

1386
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:41,867
那他们就知道自己是谁了,
then they know who they are,

1387
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,633
他们有发言权，他们可以对坏的影响说不,
they have a voice and they can say no to bad influences,

1388
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:46,600
他们知道自己是谁。
they know who they are.

1389
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:48,067
我觉得这会让他们更强大。
I think it makes them stronger.

1390
01:18:50,067 --> 01:18:51,400
如果我能学到点什么,
donovan: if I would learn something,

1391
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:54,300
而是如何帮助别人
it would be how to help people

1392
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:57,433
教人们怎么做艺术。
and teach people how to do the art stuff.

1393
01:18:57,467 --> 01:18:59,800
我就像变了一个人,
angel: i'm just like a different person,

1394
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:05,233
好像我更成熟，也知道如何更好地处理情况。
like i'm more mature and I know how to handle situations better.

1395
01:19:05,267 --> 01:19:07,267
凯茜: 我认为贵格会教徒的原则之一
cathy: I think one of the Quaker principles

1396
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:10,767
一直跟我说话的就是在别人身上看到上帝的影子
that has always spoken to me is seeing that of God in others

1397
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,200
能在这些孩子身上看到上帝的影子
and being able to see that of God in these kids

1398
01:19:13,233 --> 01:19:15,700
帮助他们看到自己的优点。
and helping them to see that in themselves.

1399
01:19:15,733 --> 01:19:17,800
我的意思是，我认为，某种程度上，简而言之,
I mean, I think that's, sort of, in a nutshell,

1400
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:19,200
重点是什么。
what the whole point is.

1401
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,767
同样得到辛辛那提朋友会的支持,
narrator: also supported by cincinnati friends meeting,

1402
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,367
luke 和 Angela Ebner 表达了他们的信仰
luke and angela ebner express their faith

1403
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,133
通过和市中心的年轻人一起工作,
through work with inner city youth,

1404
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:34,767
让他们接触有机物和永续园艺
exposing them to organic and sustainable gardening,

1405
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,467
“播下希望的种子”
"planting seeds of hope."

1406
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,200
和我们一起工作的孩子
luke: the kids that work with us

1407
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:42,667
学习如何种植植物,
get to learn how to plant plants,

1408
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:47,733
收获，销售，烹饪有机水果和蔬菜
harvest, market, cook organic fruits and vegetables

1409
01:19:47,767 --> 01:19:49,667
都长在这里。
that are all grown right here.

1410
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,567
我总是说，我们种植有营养的栖息地
I always say we're planting nourishing habitats

1411
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,333
为了我们的社区。
for our community.

1412
01:19:57,367 --> 01:20:03,200
所以这是一个滋养的栖息地，我得到培养
so this is a nourishing habitat that I get to cultivate

1413
01:20:03,233 --> 01:20:07,467
和我们接触的年轻人。
with the youth that we interact with.

1414
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,600
生活在城市社区真的很难
robert: living in an urban community it's really hard

1415
01:20:10,633 --> 01:20:12,667
享受那段调解与和平的时光
to have that time of mediation and peace

1416
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,400
因为总是有那么多事情发生。
because there's always so much going on.

1417
01:20:14,433 --> 01:20:16,333
这里人口稠密。
and this is a highly populated area.

1418
01:20:16,367 --> 01:20:18,233
所以像园艺这样隐蔽的地方,
so being in a secluded area like gardening,

1419
01:20:18,267 --> 01:20:21,367
它带给你一种你从来不知道存在的平静。
it brings you a peace that you never even knew existed.

1420
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,367
能够种植粮食真是一件幸事
and it's truly a blessing to be able to grow food

1421
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,033
因为工作需要而退出
and to just be out because putting your hands at work

1422
01:20:28,067 --> 01:20:31,067
真正让你的思想沉思和流畅
and really allow your mind to meditate and just flow

1423
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,333
在草丛中迷失自我
and losing yourself while being in the grass

1424
01:20:33,367 --> 01:20:35,467
或者照料植物之类的
or tending to the plants or whatnot

1425
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,767
你真的有机会去思考。
you really get the opportunity to think.

1426
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:44,433
花园外的生活就像是一个挑战。
rashawn: life outside the garden is much like a challenge.

1427
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:47,067
就像在花园里工作一样。
it's much like working at the garden.

1428
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:51,333
就像我说的，努力做任何你想做的事
like I said, putting forth effort to do anything you want

1429
01:20:51,367 --> 01:20:53,333
需要练习、努力工作和奉献精神。
takes practice, hard work, and dedication.

1430
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:57,167
我曾经无处可去。
robert: there was a time in my life when I had nowhere to go.

1431
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,533
我不得不来到这个花园 Luke 给了我一份工作,
and I had to come to this garden and luke gave me a job,

1432
01:20:59,567 --> 01:21:00,800
他确保我口袋里有钱,
he made sure I had money in my pocket,

1433
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:04,167
他确保这些钱足够我养家糊口。
he made sure it was enough for me to help support my family.

1434
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,367
这个花园对我来说就是一切，真的。
this garden means everything to me, truly.

1435
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,267
我在这里工作时学到的关于平等的知识
what i've learned about equality while working here

1436
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:12,033
在生态园里，我们都在同一条船上,
at the eco garden is that we all are in the same boat,

1437
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:13,433
没有人比别人更好。
no one is better than no one else.

1438
01:21:13,467 --> 01:21:15,300
即使有人可能有更好的衣服
even though someone might have better clothes

1439
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:18,167
或者有更好的职业或者更好的选择
or might have a better career or better options

1440
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,567
或者机会，在一天结束的时候
or opportunities, at the end of the day

1441
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,567
我们都是有着相同缺点和问题的人。
we're all human beings with the same faults and issues.

1442
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,033
说到底，我们害怕的东西是一样的。
at the end of the day, we're all afraid of the same things.

1443
01:21:25,067 --> 01:21:27,533
所以真的没有必要看到你上面的人
so truly there's no point in seeing anyone above you

1444
01:21:27,567 --> 01:21:29,767
或者在你之下，没有任何不安全感
or below you, there's no point of insecurity

1445
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,033
因为我们都在同一条船上,
because we're all in the same boat,

1446
01:21:31,067 --> 01:21:32,200
我们都害怕同一件事,
we're all scared of the same thing,

1447
01:21:32,233 --> 01:21:33,433
我们都在寻找同样的东西。
we all seek the same thing.
