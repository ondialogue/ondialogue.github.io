00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:16,100
[music]

2
00:00:16,133 --> 00:00:20,033
We utterly deny all outward wars and strife,

3
00:00:20,067 --> 00:00:21,767
and fighting with outward weapons,

4
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:26,667
for any end, or under any pretense whatsoever;

5
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:29,200
this is our testimony to the world...

6
00:00:32,267 --> 00:00:34,767
This is the "peace testimony,"

7
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,600
first proclaimed in 1660 to king charles ii of england

8
00:00:39,633 --> 00:00:43,400
by a group of religious seekers led by george fox

9
00:00:43,433 --> 00:00:47,033
and calling themselves the "children of light",

10
00:00:47,067 --> 00:00:50,033
or "publishers of truth."

11
00:00:50,067 --> 00:00:52,800
To their critics they were known as "Quakers,"

12
00:00:52,833 --> 00:00:56,600
a derisive nickname that they unabashedly acknowledged

13
00:00:56,633 --> 00:00:59,233
as they were known for trembling under the influence

14
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:03,367
of the holy spirit in their worship meetings.

15
00:01:03,400 --> 00:01:06,367
Ultimately, they would officially name themselves

16
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,400
"The Religious Society of Friends."

17
00:01:09,433 --> 00:01:14,200
Their visionary leader, George Fox, wrote in 1683:

18
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,300
"God, who made all,

19
00:01:17,333 --> 00:01:21,667
pours out his spirit upon all men and women in the world,

20
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:24,200
in the days of his new covenant,

21
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:30,433
yea, upon whites and blacks, moors, and turks, and Indians,

22
00:01:30,467 --> 00:01:36,700
Christians, Jews, and gentiles, that all with the spirit of God,

23
00:01:36,733 --> 00:01:40,300
might know God and the things of God,

24
00:01:40,333 --> 00:01:45,333
and serve and worship, in spirit and truth".

25
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:50,167
Be patterns, be examples in all countries,

26
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,667
places, islands, nations, wherever you come,

27
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,300
that your carriage

28
00:01:56,333 --> 00:02:00,633
and life may preach among all sorts of people,

29
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:01,833
and to them;

30
00:02:01,867 --> 00:02:06,033
then you will come to walk cheerfully over the world,

31
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:09,367
answering that of God in every one.

32
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,533
That of God in everyone as it was originally used,

33
00:02:15,567 --> 00:02:18,767
really referred to people being made

34
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:20,667
in the image and likeness of God.

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:25,400
We all share the same Father with the same parents.

36
00:02:25,433 --> 00:02:26,700
We're all children of God,

37
00:02:26,733 --> 00:02:27,967
we're all children of the same God.

38
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,700
We need to recognize that that's what we need to be responding to

39
00:02:31,733 --> 00:02:34,600
in other people, is that common humanity

40
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:38,167
that we have, the inward light of Christ.

41
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:41,200
And just as the light from the sun

42
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:45,133
allows us to see with our eyes, our outward eyes,

43
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:46,600
we have inward eyes

44
00:02:46,633 --> 00:02:51,767
and when we are illuminated by that inward light of God,

45
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,467
we can see our spiritual condition

46
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:57,533
and understand what it is God's calling on us to do.

47
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:01,467
As the movement grew in number and momentum,

48
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,533
that inner light led Quakers to pivotal roles

49
00:03:04,567 --> 00:03:07,600
in many of the most transformative moments

50
00:03:07,633 --> 00:03:10,100
of the last four centuries.

51
00:03:10,133 --> 00:03:15,367
Quakers such as William Penn, Susan B. Anthony, Lucretia Mott,

52
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:18,333
John Woolman and George Cadbury

53
00:03:18,367 --> 00:03:20,433
have achieved a degree of fame,

54
00:03:20,467 --> 00:03:24,333
but less is known about thousands of other Friends,

55
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:27,200
such as those from the American midwest,

56
00:03:27,233 --> 00:03:29,667
whose faithfulness to Quaker ideals

57
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:33,433
positively impacted the larger society.

58
00:03:33,467 --> 00:03:37,200
And these are the previously untold stories

59
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:41,267
of some of those architects of peace and equality.

61
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:14,233
Quakers left England in the 17th century

62
00:04:14,267 --> 00:04:17,067
to establish a colony in the new world -

63
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,333
William Penn's "Holy Experiment" -

64
00:04:20,367 --> 00:04:23,767
inspired by the idea of living where they could be governed

65
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:25,533
according to their faith.

66
00:04:25,567 --> 00:04:29,200
Penn had been given the land by King Charles II

67
00:04:29,233 --> 00:04:32,300
to settle a large family debt.

68
00:04:32,333 --> 00:04:36,200
So in 1682, he sails across the ocean

69
00:04:36,233 --> 00:04:42,067
with a group of colonists, most of whom are Quakers.

70
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:46,167
But he doesn't say to the people already living there,

71
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,100
"This is mine."

72
00:04:47,133 --> 00:04:49,533
What he says is, "I am going to buy it.",

73
00:04:49,567 --> 00:04:54,333
he says this not only to the Swedes and the Dutch.

75
00:04:54,367 --> 00:04:57,167
He says it to the Indians as well.

76
00:04:57,200 --> 00:05:01,100
He says, "This is land that we want to settle on.

77
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,600
"we recognize it as your land

78
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:05,533
and we will purchase it from you,"

79
00:05:05,567 --> 00:05:10,133
and begins, the first are the number of treaties

80
00:05:10,167 --> 00:05:17,300
that Pen and his sons make with the Indians to buy land

81
00:05:17,333 --> 00:05:21,567
that the king has already given to Penn.

82
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:23,633
After an encounter with Penn,

83
00:05:23,667 --> 00:05:28,500
Tamanend, a native american delaware chief, declared:

84
00:05:28,533 --> 00:05:31,367
"We will live in love with William Penn

85
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:35,133
and his children as long as the creeks and rivers run,

86
00:05:35,167 --> 00:05:39,567
and while the sun, moon, and stars endure.

87
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,233
Penn writes this constitution

88
00:05:42,267 --> 00:05:47,267
allowing people freedom to worship,

89
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:53,267
abolishing the death penalty except in some very--

90
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:57,333
I think if you engaged in treason you still be executed,

91
00:05:57,367 --> 00:06:03,667
but beyond that, this was an amazingly liberal document

92
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:06,233
that he put together.

93
00:06:06,267 --> 00:06:08,500
The Quaker colony, Pennsylvania,

94
00:06:08,533 --> 00:06:11,333
was open to all and governed with laws

95
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:15,700
based on equality, truth, simplicity and peace.

96
00:06:18,733 --> 00:06:22,467
Peace requires justice, justice requires law.

97
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:23,733
law requires government,

98
00:06:23,767 --> 00:06:27,433
not only within nations but also between nations.

99
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:31,133
~~ william penn, 1693.

100
00:06:31,167 --> 00:06:32,567
If you could only build a state

101
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,200
where people would be free,

102
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:37,800
they could have freedom of religion,

103
00:06:37,833 --> 00:06:40,367
they could have freedom to express themselves,

104
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,600
there could be equality,

105
00:06:41,633 --> 00:06:46,700
women could be as equal as men, could have the same rights,

106
00:06:46,733 --> 00:06:48,500
could do the same things as men,

107
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:52,100
there would be no need to own slaves,

108
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:56,267
that each in their own way would give to the community,

109
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,733
that you would have a just government,

110
00:06:58,767 --> 00:07:04,600
that would look out for everyone within the society.

111
00:07:04,633 --> 00:07:08,267
Unfortunately, by the time of the American revolution,

112
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:12,433
there were more non-Quakers than Quakers in Pennsylvania,

113
00:07:12,467 --> 00:07:14,700
and the Holy Experiment came to an end

114
00:07:14,733 --> 00:07:17,300
as Quakers were voted out of office

115
00:07:17,333 --> 00:07:20,700
or left office rather than participate in decisions

116
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:23,533
related to war-making.

117
00:07:23,567 --> 00:07:27,133
He thought he was going to establish a utopia,

118
00:07:27,167 --> 00:07:35,033
a heaven on earth and found out that the tough realities of life

119
00:07:35,067 --> 00:07:37,567
really get in the way.

120
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:44,267
But he did create this colony, he created this model.

121
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:48,800
We have the model of religious freedom

122
00:07:48,833 --> 00:07:52,767
that Penn establishes in Pennsylvania.

123
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,667
And the constitution of the Unites States,

124
00:07:54,700 --> 00:08:00,467
in some ways draws on things that he wrote in the 1680s,

125
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:02,300
almost 100 years earlier.

126
00:08:03,533 --> 00:08:06,500
Though they were no longer a majority in Pennsylvania,

128
00:08:06,533 --> 00:08:09,500
Quakers had spread throughout the American colonies

129
00:08:09,533 --> 00:08:13,067
with substantial settlements in rhode island, New Jersey,

130
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:17,533
Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia.

132
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,500
As the colonies in the new land developed,

133
00:08:31,533 --> 00:08:34,500
slavery became a part of the economic system.

134
00:08:34,533 --> 00:08:38,467
But Quakers were to follow a different path.

135
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:43,300
Through the 1700s, friends urged their members who owned slaves

136
00:08:43,333 --> 00:08:46,533
to free them and make provisions for their welfare

137
00:08:46,567 --> 00:08:52,600
and by 1784 virtually no Quakers owned slaves.

138
00:08:52,633 --> 00:08:57,067
The slave economy became strong in the south,

139
00:08:57,100 --> 00:09:03,767
so in 1806 my family group of Quakers

140
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,033
move from the North Carolina Piedmont area, to Ohio.

141
00:09:08,067 --> 00:09:11,767
They did not want to raise their children in that slave society.

142
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:17,800
So it was a matter of conscious and also a matter of economics,

143
00:09:17,833 --> 00:09:21,133
a matter of looking for a life that would be better

144
00:09:21,167 --> 00:09:24,367
for their community and their families.

145
00:09:25,167 --> 00:09:28,700
Appalled by the cruelty of slavery around them,

146
00:09:28,733 --> 00:09:30,433
and attracted to the possibility

147
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:33,267
of living where slavery was prohibited,

148
00:09:33,300 --> 00:09:35,467
many southern Quakers began moving

149
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,333
to the northwest territory,

150
00:09:37,367 --> 00:09:40,267
settling first on land that now includes

151
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,467
the states of Ohio and Indiana.

152
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:48,267
In 1787 congress passed the northwest ordinance,

153
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:53,600
which was to provide for the organization of government

154
00:09:53,633 --> 00:09:59,600
and settlement of the lands north of the Ohio river.

155
00:09:59,633 --> 00:10:03,433
What was probably the best element of the ordinance;

156
00:10:03,467 --> 00:10:07,067
however, was its provision that neither slavery

157
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:09,533
nor involuntary servitude

158
00:10:09,567 --> 00:10:15,167
would ever exist in the lands of the northwest territory.

159
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,500
And Friends are drawn toward territories

160
00:10:18,533 --> 00:10:20,600
where slavery is illegal.

161
00:10:21,567 --> 00:10:24,767
Daniel Boone, who grew up a pennsylvania Quaker,

162
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,400
was among those who helped friends move west

163
00:10:27,433 --> 00:10:31,300
in search of a place to live in peace and equality.

164
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,100
Let peace, descending from her native heaven,

165
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,767
bid her olives spring amidst the joyful nations;

166
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:42,400
and plenty, in league with commerce,

167
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:45,300
scatter blessings from her copious hand!

168
00:10:45,333 --> 00:10:48,200
Daniel Boone, 1784.

169
00:10:48,833 --> 00:10:52,367
In 1799, two Quaker families

170
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:56,533
from bush river, south Carolina, settled on "Military Lands"

171
00:10:56,567 --> 00:11:00,267
in southwestern Ohio, just north of fort Washington,

172
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,600
the site of what would, in a few years,

173
00:11:02,633 --> 00:11:06,367
become the thriving river port town of Cincinnati.

174
00:11:08,167 --> 00:11:12,267
In 1803, joined by more migrating Friends,

175
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:15,200
they established the first formally recognized

176
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:18,267
Quaker meeting for worship, or "church",

177
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
in southwestern Ohio:

178
00:11:20,333 --> 00:11:25,133
Miami monthly meeting in the village of Waynesville.

179
00:11:25,167 --> 00:11:27,533
And that same year, something was to happen

180
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,800
back in bush river, south Carolina

181
00:11:29,833 --> 00:11:32,767
that would open the floodgates for Quaker migration

182
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,667
to the northwest territory.

183
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:38,167
Zachariah Dix, a Quaker,

184
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:40,433
described by those who heard him speak,

185
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,500
as "a powerful rhapsodical preacher"

186
00:11:43,533 --> 00:11:47,700
with "prophetic insight in an unusual degree,"

187
00:11:47,733 --> 00:11:50,400
delivered a disturbing message.

188
00:11:51,567 --> 00:11:56,300
By the 1790s, Friends had come to believe

189
00:11:56,333 --> 00:12:00,100
that Zacharias had a gift of prophecy.

190
00:12:00,133 --> 00:12:05,067
That he could see into people's minds

191
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:10,433
and understand what their secret spiritual states were.

192
00:12:10,467 --> 00:12:15,267
And that he had foreshadowings of the future.

193
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,600
As friends recorded their memories of his preaching

194
00:12:20,633 --> 00:12:24,433
decades later, what Zacharias had to say to them

195
00:12:24,467 --> 00:12:30,500
was something like this, "Woe unto thee bush river.

196
00:12:30,533 --> 00:12:34,033
The flower of thy glory has faded.

197
00:12:34,067 --> 00:12:38,133
Get thee, hence, out of this land of egyptian slavery

198
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:43,700
and darkness unto the free lands of the northwest."

199
00:12:43,733 --> 00:12:49,267
And within a few years, a Quaker community that had numbered,

200
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,733
probably close to 1000 people,

201
00:12:52,767 --> 00:12:57,467
was fewer than a hundred left in south Carolina.

202
00:12:57,500 --> 00:13:00,600
The Quakers who came here to the midwest

203
00:13:00,633 --> 00:13:04,533
were those who were maybe more risk-takers.

204
00:13:04,567 --> 00:13:07,167
They left homes,

205
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,767
well-established farms and villages

206
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,100
and families back east and moved west.

207
00:13:13,133 --> 00:13:16,167
A lot of Quakers stayed on the east,

208
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,700
you know, where their farms and families were,

209
00:13:17,733 --> 00:13:19,133
and they did good work there,

210
00:13:19,167 --> 00:13:21,167
but the ones who came west,

211
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,433
took all sorts of risks and chances,

212
00:13:23,467 --> 00:13:26,300
and it strikes me, we may know less about them

213
00:13:26,333 --> 00:13:29,533
because they were doers more than writers.

214
00:13:29,567 --> 00:13:32,267
They didn't necessarily sit and write down what they had done,

215
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:34,300
they were out there just doing it.

216
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:38,767
A large number of Quakers continued migrating

217
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:43,400
to present-day Indiana and Ohio just like those from bush river,

218
00:13:43,433 --> 00:13:47,567
faithfully following guidance from their inner light.

219
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,700
Quakers wherever they form communities,

220
00:13:50,733 --> 00:13:53,633
first formed a meeting for worship.

221
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:57,000
The next thing they did was to open a school for their children.

223
00:13:57,033 --> 00:14:02,300
Those Quaker schools are often admitting non-Quaker students.

225
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:06,067
And some of them gained a reputation as being

226
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,800
some of the best secondary schools in the midwest.

227
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:13,167
After statehood in 1803,

228
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,600
a public school system was set up,

229
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,767
but black children were not admitted to it.

230
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:23,433
Even though black landowners were forced to pay taxes

231
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:25,667
that subsidized the public schools,

232
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:29,200
their children could not attend those schools.

233
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:32,467
So if black children were to be educated,

234
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,633
that means that their parents or sympathetic whites

235
00:14:38,667 --> 00:14:40,533
had to make that possible.

236
00:14:40,567 --> 00:14:42,100
In Harveysburg,

237
00:14:42,133 --> 00:14:44,133
which is just a few miles from Waynesville,

238
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,133
there was a Quaker meeting there,

239
00:14:46,167 --> 00:14:47,700
and there were two Quakers,

240
00:14:47,733 --> 00:14:50,467
Elizabeth Harvey and her husband.

241
00:14:50,500 --> 00:14:56,100
They started the first for children of color in Ohio,

242
00:14:56,133 --> 00:14:59,667
which was early and really unheard of at the time,

243
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:05,267
and highly frowned on and got a lot of criticism from people

244
00:15:05,300 --> 00:15:07,733
who weren't friends.

245
00:15:07,767 --> 00:15:11,267
One of the things that really feeds freedom

246
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:15,300
is not a place to hide but a place where you can learn,

247
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:21,033
a place where you can become a part of the economic community,

248
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:22,400
build a home for your family,

249
00:15:22,433 --> 00:15:25,133
and then send your children back to school.

250
00:15:25,167 --> 00:15:30,367
And Harveysburg created a school for black students

251
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:35,067
and then even hire black and white teachers.

252
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:40,033
And so it was important because it started at the base.

253
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,367
For early friends of course,

254
00:15:41,400 --> 00:15:44,000
this is just plain scripture.

255
00:15:46,167 --> 00:15:47,667
Equality is...

256
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:50,633
you look in the epistle from Paul

257
00:15:50,667 --> 00:15:55,167
and it says in christ there is no male or female,

258
00:15:55,200 --> 00:16:00,333
there is no Greek or Jew, there is no slave or free.

259
00:16:00,367 --> 00:16:06,200
If we are part of the body of christ, we are all the same

260
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:08,733
and so the social distinctions that were made

261
00:16:08,767 --> 00:16:11,033
and still are made to a degree

262
00:16:11,067 --> 00:16:12,767
between people of different backgrounds

263
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:16,767
and different genders, those are all irrelevant.

264
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:22,300
Those are all outward things, but internally we are all,

265
00:16:22,333 --> 00:16:24,167
as I said, children of God,

266
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:27,733
and are all equally children of God.

267
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:29,567
As more and more of the country

268
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,633
began relying upon slave labor for productivity and cost savings,

270
00:16:34,667 --> 00:16:37,133
Quakers throughout the northwest territory

271
00:16:37,167 --> 00:16:40,467
continued to make the difficult and dangerous choice

272
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:43,700
of supporting freedom for all.

273
00:16:43,733 --> 00:16:47,300
Christopher Anthony, a founding member of the Quaker meeting

274
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,300
in Cincinnati, Ohio,

275
00:16:49,333 --> 00:16:54,233
was one of many Quakers to give up his reliance on slave labor.

276
00:16:54,267 --> 00:16:56,974
Mary P. Hart was Christopher Anthony's granddaughter, 

278
00:16:56,974 --> 00:17:05,167
and fortunately, she had the wherewithal to share her memories

279
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:10,333
of the meeting house and some of the oral history of her family

280
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:12,733
and how they came to arrive in Cincinnati.

281
00:17:14,467 --> 00:17:16,367
"The household goods came in Wagons

282
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,600
and with them a family of negroes.

283
00:17:18,633 --> 00:17:21,600
The man was a descendant of a slave of grandfather's

284
00:17:21,633 --> 00:17:24,800
before grandfather joined the Society of Friends,

285
00:17:24,833 --> 00:17:27,467
at which time he set all his slaves free".

286
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:29,400
~ Mary P. Hart.

287
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:31,733
Even for Quakers

288
00:17:31,767 --> 00:17:35,033
living in the slavery free northwest territory,

289
00:17:35,067 --> 00:17:38,133
it was impossible to avoid being drawn into

290
00:17:38,167 --> 00:17:42,567
the most contentious debate in the history of our nation.

291
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:46,667
Many Friends combined intellect and creativity

292
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:51,067
to overcome opposition to their work for peace and equality.

293
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,367
Levi and Catherine Coffin are prime examples

294
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:57,500
of such moral ingenuity.

295
00:17:57,533 --> 00:17:59,700
In the 1830s and 1840s,

296
00:17:59,733 --> 00:18:04,167
the town of newport in Wayne county, Indiana,

297
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,233
had a reputation as being one of the most radical

298
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:11,733
anti-slavery centers in the United States.

299
00:18:11,767 --> 00:18:16,100
It was widely known that hundreds of fugitive slaves

300
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:18,300
had passed through newport;

301
00:18:18,333 --> 00:18:20,767
most of them through the Coffin home,

302
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:24,100
and he estimated that,

303
00:18:24,133 --> 00:18:27,167
I believe, in the course of their lives

304
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,033
from 1826 to 1865 they had aided somewhere between

305
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:35,667
two and three thousand fugitives.

306
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:38,133
And to the best of his knowledge none of them

307
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:41,067
was ever seized and returned to slavery.

308
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,800
Levi Coffin was an effective conductor

309
00:18:43,833 --> 00:18:45,533
on the underground railroad

310
00:18:45,567 --> 00:18:47,533
not just because he was a committed abolitionist,

311
00:18:47,567 --> 00:18:51,633
but also because he was a smart, committed abolitionist.

312
00:18:51,667 --> 00:19:00,300
He knew that if slave capturers invaded newport or even his home,

314
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:03,467
they would have the force of law behind them.

315
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,800
And so he tried to think of ways

316
00:19:05,833 --> 00:19:08,600
that he might be able to outwit them.

317
00:19:08,633 --> 00:19:13,467
and you can see three examples of that here at the house.

318
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,367
The first is the well, which is inside.

319
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,033
And of course, that would have been convenient.

320
00:19:19,067 --> 00:19:24,233
But it also had the advantage that snoopy neighbors who might

321
00:19:24,267 --> 00:19:29,367
not be sympathetic would never be able to notice just how much

322
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,700
water the coffins were drawing for their own use

323
00:19:32,733 --> 00:19:38,033
or for the 18 fugitive slaves that they might have with them,

324
00:19:38,067 --> 00:19:39,667
at any given time.

325
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:42,800
In the attic, there is a hiding place,

326
00:19:42,833 --> 00:19:48,067
one where people could have been concealed, if necessary.

327
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,233
they also have a false bottom wagon,

328
00:19:51,267 --> 00:19:53,800
which would have been another effective way

329
00:19:53,833 --> 00:19:56,767
to transport fugitive slaves.

330
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:59,767
They would have been particularly in danger

331
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:02,067
when they're on the open road.

332
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:07,233
So if you think that slave catchers may be on your trail,

333
00:20:07,267 --> 00:20:09,533
the false bottom wagon is an excellent way

334
00:20:09,567 --> 00:20:11,500
to transport a freedom seeker.

335
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:12,800
I think, to me, it's a good example

336
00:20:12,833 --> 00:20:17,100
of combining practicality with a moral witness.

337
00:20:17,133 --> 00:20:21,033
He didn't try and hide from the sheriff.

338
00:20:21,067 --> 00:20:23,100
He was just open about it

339
00:20:23,133 --> 00:20:29,533
and this is what real civil disobedience is about.

340
00:20:29,567 --> 00:20:32,400
Civil disobedience is saying this law is wrong.

341
00:20:32,433 --> 00:20:33,667
I am not going to follow it

342
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:39,633
and doing it out where people can catch you if they want to.

343
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:44,033
He didn't hide the fact that he was, not just a conductor,

344
00:20:44,067 --> 00:20:45,400
on the underground railroad,

345
00:20:45,433 --> 00:20:47,600
he was described at that time as the president

346
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:48,500
of the underground railroad

347
00:20:48,533 --> 00:20:53,200
and he was described that way publicly.

348
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:54,033
In his memoir,

349
00:20:54,067 --> 00:20:56,467
Levi Coffin recounts a conversation

350
00:20:56,500 --> 00:20:58,267
with a man who disapproved

351
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:01,433
of his helping slaves escape from their masters.

352
00:21:03,167 --> 00:21:05,700
I told him I had read in the bible when I was a boy,

353
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:08,500
that it was right to feed the hungry and clothe the naked,

354
00:21:08,533 --> 00:21:11,167
and to minister to those who had fallen among thieves

355
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,100
and were wounded,

356
00:21:12,133 --> 00:21:14,200
but that no distinction in regard to color

357
00:21:14,233 --> 00:21:15,800
was mentioned in the good book,

358
00:21:15,833 --> 00:21:18,167
so in accordance with its teachings

359
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,767
I had received these fugitives and cared for them.

360
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:24,100
I then asked: "Was I right, friend, in doing so?"

361
00:21:24,133 --> 00:21:27,067
He hesitated and seemed at a loss how to reply.

362
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:29,233
I continued: "How does thy bible read?

363
00:21:29,267 --> 00:21:31,167
Was it not as I have said?"

364
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:34,233
"Yes, he answered, it reads somehow so."

365
00:21:34,267 --> 00:21:36,700
He evidently wished to change the subject.

366
00:21:36,733 --> 00:21:38,600
~ Levi Coffin.

367
00:21:38,633 --> 00:21:42,567
In addition to helping fugitives escape from slavery,

368
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,333
Coffin and other abolitionists worked to undermine

369
00:21:46,367 --> 00:21:48,267
its economic foundation,

370
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:52,033
buying and selling products such as cotton and sugar

371
00:21:52,067 --> 00:21:56,800
from plantations that hired free laborers instead of using slaves.

373
00:21:56,833 --> 00:22:00,233
In 1846, a group of abolitionists

374
00:22:00,267 --> 00:22:04,067
decided to establish a free labor wholesale warehouse

375
00:22:04,100 --> 00:22:08,700
in Cincinnati and urged Levi Coffin to oversee its operation.

377
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:11,600
in the spring, Levi and Catherine Coffin

378
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:14,133
moved from their home in Newport, Indiana

379
00:22:14,167 --> 00:22:16,233
to Cincinnati, Ohio.

380
00:22:16,267 --> 00:22:18,367
Throughout their years in Cincinnati,

381
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,100
the Coffins also helped those who sought freedom

382
00:22:21,133 --> 00:22:23,800
by providing opportunities for education,

383
00:22:23,833 --> 00:22:27,767
teaching simple skills denied those oppressed by slavery.

384
00:22:28,767 --> 00:22:30,467
People like Levi Coffin

385
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:32,300
not only provided you with shelter

386
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:36,667
but then provided you with hope.

387
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:38,767
In helping black people learn to read, write

388
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:43,333
in the basement of union baptist church, that's freedom.

390
00:22:43,367 --> 00:22:45,567
And even if they catch you and take you back

391
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,500
they don't own you anymore.

392
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:54,767
Coffin and other people like him understood that physical freedom

393
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,633
with no job and no way to take care of your family

394
00:22:57,667 --> 00:23:00,300
is just another form of slavery.

395
00:23:00,333 --> 00:23:01,567
Another Cincinnati friend

396
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,633
who took the testimony against slavery particularly to heart

397
00:23:05,667 --> 00:23:08,133
was mordecai morris white.

398
00:23:08,167 --> 00:23:11,300
His maternal grandfather was a wealthy plantation owner,

399
00:23:11,333 --> 00:23:16,500
and in 1846, when Morris White was only 16 years old,

400
00:23:16,533 --> 00:23:19,633
he inherited a large estate from his grandfather,

401
00:23:19,667 --> 00:23:22,800
including a number of slaves.

402
00:23:22,833 --> 00:23:24,733
When he was in his early twenties

403
00:23:24,767 --> 00:23:29,800
and living in Cincinnati as a young businessman,

404
00:23:29,833 --> 00:23:34,467
the realization that he was a slave owner began to bother him,

405
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:39,500
so he made the journey on horseback

406
00:23:39,533 --> 00:23:42,100
all the way down to North Carolina,

407
00:23:42,133 --> 00:23:43,300
registered his slaves

408
00:23:43,333 --> 00:23:48,367
to establish his ownership and his ability to free them,

409
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,567
and then at three in the morning started on a journey

410
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,567
back to the midwest.

411
00:23:57,733 --> 00:24:02,633
When he got to Norfolk, he was offered $10,000 in gold

412
00:24:02,667 --> 00:24:07,300
for his gang of slaves, and turned it down.

413
00:24:07,333 --> 00:24:11,533
The personal property value

414
00:24:11,567 --> 00:24:16,600
of the six million slaves in the south was worth more money

416
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:20,767
than all the factories and inventory of everything up north.

418
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:28,300
And so, when you ask that that be taken away and given away,

419
00:24:28,333 --> 00:24:30,500
that would be like telling procter & gamble

420
00:24:30,533 --> 00:24:32,133
to give away all their soap.

421
00:24:32,167 --> 00:24:35,467
We don't realize how much value there was

422
00:24:35,500 --> 00:24:39,367
and we don't have any idea of what it was like

423
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:42,100
to have the courage to run away.

424
00:24:42,133 --> 00:24:45,300
Eventually Mordecai White's group made its way

425
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:48,500
to Raysville, Indiana, a settlement of Quakers

426
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:52,100
and free people of color where white had relatives.

427
00:24:52,133 --> 00:24:55,067
There, White rented and furnished two houses

428
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,633
for his former slaves, and found jobs for the men chopping wood,

429
00:24:58,667 --> 00:25:01,367
making fencing rails, and other employment

430
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:04,600
that would allow them to provide for themselves.

431
00:25:04,633 --> 00:25:07,633
It's a risk to let your life speak what you believe.

432
00:25:07,667 --> 00:25:10,133
So it doesn't matter what you say you believe,

433
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:15,233
if your actions are showing a different belief, then it doesn't matter.

435
00:25:15,267 --> 00:25:18,633
But it is risky.

436
00:25:18,667 --> 00:25:20,733
Quakers who did not directly protect

437
00:25:20,767 --> 00:25:24,233
and guide slaves to freedom on the underground railroad

438
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:27,333
found other ways to contribute, such as cincinnati friend,

439
00:25:27,367 --> 00:25:32,367
achilles pugh and clinton county Quakers, Isaac and Sarah Harvey.

441
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Pugh owned a printing company

442
00:25:34,433 --> 00:25:38,133
that published, "The Philanthropist"

443
00:25:38,167 --> 00:25:41,067
that was written by James Birney.

444
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:50,133
Birney was like Levi Coffin and like John Rankin from Ripley.

445
00:25:50,167 --> 00:25:53,600
And that Birney was a southerner,

446
00:25:53,633 --> 00:25:58,800
Birney was the son of a slave owner from Danville, Kentucky

447
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:03,100
who said this isn't right.

448
00:26:03,133 --> 00:26:05,467
And so here is a guy of privilege

449
00:26:05,500 --> 00:26:08,033
who has a strong moral base

450
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:11,233
and just turns his back on wealth

451
00:26:11,267 --> 00:26:13,267
and started writing this paper,

452
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:17,700
and some of the citizens of Cincinnati burned his press twice

454
00:26:17,733 --> 00:26:20,433
and dumped it here in the ohio river.

455
00:26:20,467 --> 00:26:22,133
What's worse they decided to go

456
00:26:22,167 --> 00:26:25,500
to achilles pugh's house that night

457
00:26:25,533 --> 00:26:27,600
to make sure that he didn't have

458
00:26:27,633 --> 00:26:30,667
any more printing equipment handy.

459
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:35,633
And it had to have been a terrifying experience,

460
00:26:35,667 --> 00:26:40,067
to have this angry mob at your front door step,

461
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,567
with your wife and your children there in your home.

462
00:26:43,600 --> 00:26:47,033
Fortunately they didn't commit any violence.

463
00:26:47,067 --> 00:26:50,700
And he could have said to himself,

464
00:26:50,733 --> 00:26:52,200
"This is too dangerous.

465
00:26:52,233 --> 00:26:54,533
I am not going to do this anymore."

466
00:26:54,567 --> 00:26:58,133
Instead he went to his printing press,

467
00:26:58,167 --> 00:27:00,600
literally picked up the pieces,

468
00:27:00,633 --> 00:27:04,033
and continuing publishing the philanthropist.

469
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:11,133
There are certain individuals who exemplify

470
00:27:11,167 --> 00:27:13,267
what it means to be a Quaker,

471
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,500
and what it has meant from the beginning,

472
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:19,367
and one of the qualities is a degree of faithfulness

473
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:23,167
to leading, to communicating

474
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:29,500
or being communicated with God and listening.

475
00:27:29,533 --> 00:27:33,767
And Isaac and Sarah Harvey are a good example of that.

476
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:40,433
In the late summer of 1862,

477
00:27:40,467 --> 00:27:43,567
he was plowing in his field

478
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:47,200
and can you imagine walking behind horses and a plow

479
00:27:47,233 --> 00:27:51,700
and that must be a very meditative kind of experience, you know.

481
00:27:51,733 --> 00:27:56,800
So he was doing this and he heard a voice that said,

482
00:27:56,833 --> 00:28:01,333
"Go to washington and talk to the president."

483
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:03,800
And he said, I don't --

484
00:28:03,833 --> 00:28:07,233
he didn't know whether the voice was outside or inside

485
00:28:07,267 --> 00:28:10,500
but he said, "I hear you."

486
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:15,467
So he unhitched his horse and took care of his horses,

487
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:19,267
went to the house and said to his wife Sarah,

488
00:28:19,300 --> 00:28:22,733
"Will you go to washington with me to see the president?"

489
00:28:22,767 --> 00:28:27,633
And she in her Quaker way says, "Who sends thee?"

490
00:28:27,667 --> 00:28:30,467
And he says, "The Lord."

491
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:35,367
So of course she's ready to go with him and they do.

492
00:28:35,400 --> 00:28:37,333
The civil war was underway

493
00:28:37,367 --> 00:28:39,633
and the country was divided and devastated,

494
00:28:39,667 --> 00:28:42,267
by both war and slavery.

495
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,167
But Isaac Harvey was convinced

496
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:47,167
God had given him a message to share

497
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,167
that might provide the solution.

498
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:55,233
So Sarah and Isaac Harvey get off the train in Washington DC.

500
00:28:55,267 --> 00:28:56,567
They don't know the city;

501
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,667
they don't know anything about it.

502
00:28:57,700 --> 00:28:58,900
They look across the street,

503
00:28:58,933 --> 00:29:02,567
and there is a fellow standing over there by a street lamp.

504
00:29:02,600 --> 00:29:06,733
So they go over to him and ask directions to the white house;

505
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:09,033
they have come to see the president.

506
00:29:09,067 --> 00:29:10,567
So he asks them a few questions

507
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:14,100
and it turns out that he is secretary of the treasury,

508
00:29:14,133 --> 00:29:15,533
Salmon P. Chase.

509
00:29:15,567 --> 00:29:16,633
He is from Cincinnati;

510
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:19,300
he had served several different political offices,

511
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:21,467
including governor of Ohio.

512
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,667
When he finds out they are from Wilmington,

513
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:27,133
and he knows they're Quakers, and he knows the area,

514
00:29:27,167 --> 00:29:30,267
he takes them, he says, "Come with me; I will get you settled."

516
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:32,767
He takes them to a boarding house or something,

517
00:29:32,800 --> 00:29:34,233
and finds them a room,

518
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,700
and he sets up an appointment with them

519
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,200
to go see Abraham Lincoln.

520
00:29:38,233 --> 00:29:40,433
So they went into the waiting room

521
00:29:40,467 --> 00:29:43,033
and many people reading the newspaper

522
00:29:43,067 --> 00:29:46,133
because the battle of antietam had just been fought

523
00:29:46,167 --> 00:29:47,700
and the north had won

524
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:50,233
but there had many, many causalities.

525
00:29:50,267 --> 00:29:53,600
So they waited thinking certainly they would probably

526
00:29:53,633 --> 00:29:57,300
never get in with all these important things going on.

527
00:29:57,333 --> 00:30:02,067
But at their appointed time, president Lincoln called them in

528
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:06,200
and they reported that president Lincoln picked up his chair

529
00:30:06,233 --> 00:30:08,733
and came over and sat between them

530
00:30:08,767 --> 00:30:12,633
so that he could talk to them more personally.

531
00:30:12,667 --> 00:30:17,267
So they talk for about half an hour

532
00:30:17,300 --> 00:30:19,800
and at the end of that time

533
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:23,367
president Lincoln signed a note

534
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:26,133
saying that they had visited with him,

535
00:30:26,167 --> 00:30:31,200
that they had comforted him and dated it.

536
00:30:31,233 --> 00:30:33,600
I take pleasure in asserting that I have had

537
00:30:33,633 --> 00:30:37,100
profitable intercourse with friend Isaac Harvey

538
00:30:37,133 --> 00:30:39,433
and his good wife Sarah Harvey.

539
00:30:39,467 --> 00:30:43,367
May the Lord comfort them as they have sustained me.

540
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:49,100
~ Abraham Lincoln - September 19, 1862.

541
00:30:49,133 --> 00:30:52,100
About two days after the Harvey visit,

542
00:30:52,133 --> 00:30:54,633
the first draft of what would become

543
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:58,133
the emancipation proclamation was given to the congress.

544
00:30:58,167 --> 00:30:59,733
In this preliminary version

545
00:30:59,767 --> 00:31:03,067
Lincoln includes in his second paragraph

546
00:31:03,100 --> 00:31:06,300
almost exactly what Isaac Harvey had suggested,

547
00:31:06,333 --> 00:31:07,367
and that is that the government,

548
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:10,767
the US government purchase slaves from the south.

549
00:31:12,667 --> 00:31:19,300
On September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued the following:

550
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:21,367
"That it is my purpose,

551
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,333
upon the next meeting of congress

552
00:31:23,367 --> 00:31:26,767
to again recommend the adoption of a practical measure

553
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:30,300
tendering pecuniary aid to the free acceptance

554
00:31:30,333 --> 00:31:33,433
or rejection of all slave states, so called,

555
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:36,267
the people whereof may not then be in rebellion

556
00:31:36,300 --> 00:31:39,033
against the united states and which states

557
00:31:39,067 --> 00:31:41,367
may then have voluntarily adopted,

558
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,033
or thereafter may voluntarily adopt,

559
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:47,333
immediate or gradual abolishment of slavery

560
00:31:47,367 --> 00:31:49,300
within their respective limits".

561
00:31:50,367 --> 00:31:53,367
And the wonderful thing that happens

562
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:56,267
when you are faithful like that,

563
00:31:56,300 --> 00:31:58,667
is that you are able to do things

564
00:31:58,700 --> 00:32:00,267
you shouldn't be able to do.

565
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:02,300
You shouldn't be able to just arrive,

566
00:32:02,333 --> 00:32:04,067
get off the train in Washington DC

567
00:32:04,100 --> 00:32:06,400
and make your way to see president Lincoln.

568
00:32:06,433 --> 00:32:08,467
And when you have that kind of confidence,

569
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,600
you are not alone and you can...

570
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:12,600
you accomplish incredible things,

571
00:32:12,633 --> 00:32:16,633
and that's along with this idea of George Fox

572
00:32:16,667 --> 00:32:20,067
when he said "Let your life so preach."

573
00:32:20,100 --> 00:32:23,400
In other words, your life will-- what you do,

574
00:32:23,433 --> 00:32:25,567
if you are faithful and tuned in and listening

575
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,267
and you act on them,

576
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:29,433
your life will speak what you believe.

577
00:32:29,467 --> 00:32:34,533
So it's a powerful message to watch someone live a faith

578
00:32:34,567 --> 00:32:36,367
and not just say it.

580
00:32:48,333 --> 00:32:51,100
Since the 17th century

581
00:32:51,133 --> 00:32:56,667
the official Quaker position has been that all wars and fighting

582
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,433
are contrary to the will of God

583
00:32:59,467 --> 00:33:05,533
and that friends as faithful christians, can never bear arms

584
00:33:05,567 --> 00:33:09,600
to deprive fellow human beings of their lives,

585
00:33:09,633 --> 00:33:11,500
even in self-defense.

586
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:13,667
The civil war is different.

587
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,300
They see the confederacy

588
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:19,033
as committed to the defense of slavery

589
00:33:19,067 --> 00:33:21,267
and that, in Quaker minds,

590
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:25,667
makes it absolutely immoral, indefensible.

591
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:30,400
So, that's the choice that friends are facing.

592
00:33:30,433 --> 00:33:34,233
If we truly accept and believe that there is indeed

593
00:33:34,267 --> 00:33:38,267
that of God in every person, then we must be a peacemaker.

594
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:43,133
We must give full justice and equality to every person

595
00:33:43,167 --> 00:33:49,167
and seek the peace and justice that the world needs

596
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:50,600
and that the spirit requires of us.

597
00:33:51,933 --> 00:33:55,467
Just as the country was divided, so were Quakers.

598
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:58,167
Torn between their abhorrence of slavery

599
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,733
and their testimony of peace,

600
00:33:59,767 --> 00:34:03,733
a number of young Quaker men joined the union army.

601
00:34:03,767 --> 00:34:05,333
A larger number, however,

602
00:34:05,367 --> 00:34:08,033
elected not to participate in violence;

603
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:10,200
for this they were labeled as cowards

604
00:34:10,233 --> 00:34:14,667
and faced derision and humiliation by society-at-large.

605
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:18,400
Although Quakers were not willing to kill for their principles,

607
00:34:18,433 --> 00:34:23,167
they were willing to suffer, and even die for them.

608
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:27,567
The 1864 Friends discipline for Quakers in Indiana

609
00:34:27,600 --> 00:34:30,533
and southwestern Ohio acknowledged the challenges

610
00:34:30,567 --> 00:34:33,667
of the peace testimony in wartime:

611
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:35,800
"If during the common course of their life,

612
00:34:35,833 --> 00:34:39,267
Friends are attacked, insulted, and persecuted,

613
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,400
they ought to suffer wrong, to revenge no injury,

614
00:34:42,433 --> 00:34:46,167
to return good for evil and love their enemies.

615
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:48,400
So also, should it happen that they are exposed

616
00:34:48,433 --> 00:34:50,733
to the more extraordinary calamities of war,

617
00:34:50,767 --> 00:34:54,600
their conduct must continue to be guided by the same principles.

619
00:34:54,633 --> 00:34:57,233
If the sword of the invader be lifted up against them,

620
00:34:57,267 --> 00:35:01,633
the precept is still at hand, that they resist not evil.

621
00:35:01,667 --> 00:35:03,700
If the insults and injuries of the carnal warrior

622
00:35:03,733 --> 00:35:05,533
be heaped upon them,

623
00:35:05,567 --> 00:35:07,700
they are still forbidden to avenge themselves,

624
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:11,533
and still commanded to pray for their persecutors.

625
00:35:11,567 --> 00:35:13,433
If they are surrounded by a host of enemies,

626
00:35:13,467 --> 00:35:16,667
however violent and malicious those enemies may be,

627
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:23,633
christian love must still be unbroken, still universal.

628
00:35:23,667 --> 00:35:25,533
While withstanding verbal

629
00:35:25,567 --> 00:35:28,433
and sometimes physical persecution,

630
00:35:28,467 --> 00:35:33,433
Friends found ways to contribute solutions while avoiding violence.

632
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,567
For instance, Mary J. Taylor,

633
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:38,267
clerk of the women's meeting in Cincinnati,

634
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:41,333
organized assistance for soldiers who were encamped

635
00:35:41,367 --> 00:35:45,667
in Garfield Park, and her son, Dr. William H. Taylor,

636
00:35:45,700 --> 00:35:48,433
provided medical services to the wounded.

637
00:35:48,467 --> 00:35:50,367
Other Cincinnati Area Friends

638
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,367
were challenged to action as well.

639
00:35:54,267 --> 00:35:56,400
Endeavor, as way may open,

640
00:35:56,433 --> 00:35:58,467
to relieve in some measure,

641
00:35:58,500 --> 00:36:01,767
the colored people now at or near Cairo,

642
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,800
who are without a home in consequence of the war

643
00:36:04,833 --> 00:36:07,400
now existing in our beloved country,

644
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,267
and who, by the laws of the land,

645
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,733
are most likely entitled to freedom from slavery...

646
00:36:12,767 --> 00:36:16,033
at this time there are about 4,000 persons,

647
00:36:16,067 --> 00:36:19,567
principally women and children, at or near that place,

648
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:22,300
the able bodied men being mostly employed

649
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:25,500
in the opposing armies, leaving their helpless fathers,

650
00:36:25,533 --> 00:36:29,500
mothers, wives, and children without the means of support.

651
00:36:29,533 --> 00:36:31,100
1862.





652
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,633
donne: there were slaves

653
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,067
who were caught in the middle of battlegrounds.

654
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:41,133
so there was dreadful suffering among the people who were slaves

655
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:45,167
and were now according to the law, freedmen,

656
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:48,600
but they were not free from suffering and poverty and so on.

657
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:53,100
narrator: Quakers formed various committees to provide support

658
00:36:53,133 --> 00:36:55,400
for those suffering because of the war,

659
00:36:55,433 --> 00:36:58,400
including the indiana yearly meeting committee

660
00:36:58,433 --> 00:37:00,767
on the concerns of the people of color

661
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:03,400
and the committee for contraband relief,

662
00:37:03,433 --> 00:37:07,033
which included representatives from cincinnati friends meeting,

663
00:37:07,067 --> 00:37:11,733
achilles pugh and murray m. shipley, among others.

664
00:37:11,767 --> 00:37:15,367
as the war came to a close and for years to follow,

665
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,333
Quakers were involved

666
00:37:16,367 --> 00:37:19,367
with picking up the broken pieces of society

667
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:21,733
and working to rebuild it.

668
00:37:21,767 --> 00:37:26,033
sabrina: according to some sources, during the civil war,

669
00:37:26,067 --> 00:37:27,333
murray shipley was involved

670
00:37:27,367 --> 00:37:30,200
in helping to establish schools in the south

671
00:37:30,233 --> 00:37:32,767
which involved going down the mississippi river,

672
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:34,667
under fire at times,

673
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,667
from either of the union forces or the confederate forces

674
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:41,767
so that he could bring relief to the people in those areas.

675
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:46,200
donne: levi coffin and other Quakers in the cincinnati area

676
00:37:46,233 --> 00:37:48,367
made trips down to alabama and mississippi

677
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:50,233
to see what was going on.

678
00:37:50,267 --> 00:37:53,133
they came back, they raised money and funds

679
00:37:53,167 --> 00:37:56,267
and they started this western freedmen's commission

680
00:37:56,300 --> 00:38:01,733
to continue to get food and clothing and supplies

681
00:38:01,767 --> 00:38:05,100
and relief for the suffering people.

682
00:38:05,133 --> 00:38:06,733
one of the first things they did,

683
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:08,767
besides feed and clothe the slaves,

684
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,433
was build schools and start teaching them,

685
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:15,200
because they understood that they would have a better chance

686
00:38:15,233 --> 00:38:18,767
of surviving in this new world, whatever it was going to be,

687
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:21,200
to survive, they were going to have to have

688
00:38:21,233 --> 00:38:23,333
some of those basic skills.

689
00:38:23,367 --> 00:38:25,167
carl: after the civil war,

690
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,667
you had four and a half million people of african descent,

691
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:33,733
most of whom had no formal education.

692
00:38:33,767 --> 00:38:38,767
and coffin not only helped them in the process of getting away,

693
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:44,200
at least 2000, but he then helped an even a larger number

694
00:38:44,233 --> 00:38:47,667
with the kind of programs that the freedman's bureau set up:

695
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:48,867
establishment of schools,

696
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,533
establishment of social services that people with nothing,

697
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:57,733
needed to begin to become full-fledged citizens.

698
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:02,400
narrator: when coffin died in 1877,

699
00:39:02,433 --> 00:39:06,200
his service was held at cincinnati friends meetinghouse.

700
00:39:06,233 --> 00:39:10,600
four of the eight pallbearers were freed black men.

701
00:39:10,633 --> 00:39:13,500
one of the speakers was rev. dr. rust,

702
00:39:13,533 --> 00:39:16,367
secretary of the freedmen's aid society

703
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,567
of the methodist episcopal church.

704
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,300
dr. rust: levi coffin had too great a mission

705
00:39:24,333 --> 00:39:26,733
to spare any time to take care of himself,

706
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:28,367
and God took care of him.

707
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:32,033
he was an honest, wise, and judicious man -

708
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:36,133
wise in selecting the most practical and judicious methods.

709
00:39:36,167 --> 00:39:39,133
he was a brave and courageous man.

710
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:42,433
it would take less bravery to go up to the cannon's mouth

711
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,367
than to do the work he did.

712
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,667
as he walked through the streets,

713
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:49,367
he was hooted at and threatened by mobs.

714
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:52,800
the battlefield has no such illustrations of heroism

715
00:39:52,833 --> 00:39:55,667
as he exhibited every day.

716
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:58,467
reverend dr. rust, 1877.

717
00:40:00,333 --> 00:40:03,133
narrator: the african american community in cincinnati

718
00:40:03,167 --> 00:40:06,267
held fund raisers to build a memorial for him,

719
00:40:06,300 --> 00:40:09,200
but it was Quaker practice to maintain simplicity

720
00:40:09,233 --> 00:40:11,367
and equality even in death.

721
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:13,500
in accordance with his wishes,

722
00:40:13,533 --> 00:40:16,100
catherine coffin had her husband buried

723
00:40:16,133 --> 00:40:19,700
in an unmarked grave in the meetings cemetery.

724
00:40:19,733 --> 00:40:23,133
when catherine coffin died in 1881,

725
00:40:23,167 --> 00:40:25,767
she was also buried in an unmarked grave

726
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:27,533
in the friends cemetery.

727
00:40:27,567 --> 00:40:31,767
twenty years later, in 1901, cincinnati friends meeting

728
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:35,767
was informed that "persons not in membership with us

729
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:39,567
"desire to erect a monument to the late levi coffin

730
00:40:39,600 --> 00:40:42,400
on our lot in spring grove cemetery."

731
00:40:42,433 --> 00:40:45,233
cincinnati friends meeting granted permission

732
00:40:45,267 --> 00:40:46,367
to erect a monument

733
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,767
so long as friends approved of the inscription.

734
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:52,733
among a few simple headstones in the Quaker section

735
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:57,200
of spring grove cemetery, stands a single six-foot marker,

736
00:40:57,233 --> 00:41:01,700
dedicated in a ceremony on may 30, 1902.

737
00:41:01,733 --> 00:41:06,267
inscribed on the monument are the following words:

738
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:11,700
female Quaker 2: levi coffin, died 9th mo. 16, 1877

739
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:15,433
in his 79th year, a christian philanthropist.

740
00:41:15,467 --> 00:41:22,367
catherine coffin died 5th mo 22,
1881 in her 78th year,

741
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,767
her work well done.

742
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:29,133
noble benefactors aiding thousands to gain freedom -

743
00:41:29,167 --> 00:41:33,067
a tribute from the colored people of cincinnati.

744
00:41:38,733 --> 00:41:48,433
[music]

745
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:51,433
narrator: after the civil war, another group that garnered

746
00:41:51,467 --> 00:41:54,233
the attention and sympathies of Quakers

747
00:41:54,267 --> 00:41:56,167
were native americans,

748
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:01,333
specifically, the cheyenne, wichita and comanche tribes.

749
00:42:01,367 --> 00:42:04,233
thomas: one of the delicious ironies of american history

750
00:42:04,267 --> 00:42:07,200
was that when general ulysses s. grant

751
00:42:07,233 --> 00:42:10,500
became president in 1869,

752
00:42:10,533 --> 00:42:13,267
he decided that the u.s. government

753
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:17,033
needed a new indian policy.

754
00:42:17,067 --> 00:42:20,767
one that emphasized peace.

755
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:26,333
one that took the administration of indian affairs

756
00:42:26,367 --> 00:42:29,167
away from the army

757
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:34,300
and private contractors and agents who were often corrupt,

758
00:42:34,333 --> 00:42:37,100
and turned it over to the churches.

759
00:42:37,133 --> 00:42:41,733
people who presumably would be humanitarian.

760
00:42:41,767 --> 00:42:47,200
who would practice peace on earth, good will toward men.

761
00:42:47,233 --> 00:42:50,533
narrator: in 1869, when a group of Quakers went to see

762
00:42:50,567 --> 00:42:53,733
president elect grant and made the suggestion

763
00:42:53,767 --> 00:42:57,233
that instead of soldiers as indian agents,

764
00:42:57,267 --> 00:42:59,333
people of faith be appointed,

765
00:42:59,367 --> 00:43:04,700
grant listened attentively to the Quakers, and responded:

766
00:43:04,733 --> 00:43:06,533
president grant: gentlemen, your advice is good.

767
00:43:06,567 --> 00:43:07,800
I accept it.

768
00:43:07,833 --> 00:43:09,767
now give me the names of some friends for indian agents

769
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:11,400
and I will appoint them.

770
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:12,800
if you can make Quakers out of the indians

771
00:43:12,833 --> 00:43:14,567
it will take the fight out of them.

772
00:43:14,600 --> 00:43:15,767
let us have peace.

773
00:43:15,800 --> 00:43:17,500
ulysses s. grant.

774
00:43:18,767 --> 00:43:21,400
narrator: thus, president ulysses s. grant

775
00:43:21,433 --> 00:43:25,433
was led to pursue what became known as the "Quaker policy,"

776
00:43:25,467 --> 00:43:27,800
the appointment of friends and other clergy

777
00:43:27,833 --> 00:43:32,500
to oversee the corruption-ridden bureau of u.s. indian affairs,

778
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:36,400
and to act as "indian agents"
across the country,

779
00:43:36,433 --> 00:43:38,433
distributing funds and supplies

780
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:42,133
to tribes who were losing more and more of their land

781
00:43:42,167 --> 00:43:43,633
to settlers from the east,

782
00:43:43,667 --> 00:43:46,567
and being forced to live on reservations.

783
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,800
it is believed that much of the motivation

784
00:43:48,833 --> 00:43:52,600
for involving the Quakers was their positive reputation

785
00:43:52,633 --> 00:43:55,700
among native american communities.

786
00:43:55,733 --> 00:43:57,300
mary: now, william penn started that.

787
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:59,467
when he came to pennsylvania,

788
00:43:59,500 --> 00:44:02,500
he made treaties with the indians.

789
00:44:02,533 --> 00:44:04,800
these treaties were not broken.

790
00:44:04,833 --> 00:44:06,500
they purchased land,

791
00:44:06,533 --> 00:44:09,433
they tried to be as honest as they could

792
00:44:09,467 --> 00:44:12,700
and as equal and fair to the native-americans.

793
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:17,633
so, that tradition was handed down through the society.

794
00:44:17,667 --> 00:44:21,367
and they built schools, helped them build mills

795
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:23,100
and provided things

796
00:44:23,133 --> 00:44:25,800
so that the native-americans could establish their own homes

797
00:44:25,833 --> 00:44:28,233
and make a life for themselves.

798
00:44:29,667 --> 00:44:31,467
narrator: once again, many of those involved

799
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:34,767
in the effort, came from the midwest.

800
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:38,500
cincinnati friend murray shipley served as chairman

801
00:44:38,533 --> 00:44:41,633
of the associated executive committee of friends

802
00:44:41,667 --> 00:44:42,800
on indian affairs,

803
00:44:42,833 --> 00:44:46,167
and other members of cincinnati meeting were appointed

804
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:51,067
as indian agents including the indomitable harriet steer,

805
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:54,367
who spent several months with tribes in missouri,

806
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,567
and achilles pugh, who traveled to kansas and oklahoma territory

807
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:03,133
with two other friends on the associated executive committee.

808
00:45:03,167 --> 00:45:06,267
initially, Quakers seemed to have the support

809
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:10,133
of the general public in their work with the plains tribes.

810
00:45:10,167 --> 00:45:12,433
the cincinnati commercial tribune reported:

811
00:45:15,267 --> 00:45:17,267
newspaper reporter: the Quaker agents are unwearied

812
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:19,400
in their efforts for the amelioration

813
00:45:19,433 --> 00:45:21,233
of the indians' condition,

814
00:45:21,267 --> 00:45:23,633
and honest in dispensing the rations

815
00:45:23,667 --> 00:45:26,800
and annuities they are entitled to receive.

816
00:45:26,833 --> 00:45:31,600
under the old system, the agents seldom lived with the tribes,

817
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:34,300
while the new agents abide with them;

818
00:45:34,333 --> 00:45:36,567
and this is a great advantage.

819
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:42,467
cincinnati commercial tribune september 23, 1869.

820
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:45,767
narrator: however, many western settlers

821
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:48,800
were not fans of the experiment.

822
00:45:48,833 --> 00:45:53,033
thomas: many of them were of the school:

823
00:45:53,067 --> 00:45:56,400
the only good indian is a dead indian.

824
00:45:56,433 --> 00:46:03,333
when they saw Quakers coming in urging justice

825
00:46:03,367 --> 00:46:05,133
for native americans,

826
00:46:05,167 --> 00:46:09,500
pointing out how very often local officials,

827
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:14,667
white settlers, were stealing from native americans,

828
00:46:14,700 --> 00:46:17,567
encroaching on their lands,

829
00:46:17,600 --> 00:46:21,767
withholding government funds that were rightly theirs,

830
00:46:21,800 --> 00:46:26,267
this did not endear Quakers to those people.

831
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:33,667
so soon, washington was being inundated by complaints

832
00:46:33,700 --> 00:46:38,467
from settlers that the Quakers were completely unrealistic

833
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:42,433
and that they were endangering the lives of settlers.

834
00:46:42,467 --> 00:46:46,067
narrator: unfortunately, the trust placed in the Quakers

835
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:49,267
by president grant was not shared by officials

836
00:46:49,300 --> 00:46:52,533
in the administration of rutherford b. hayes.

837
00:46:52,567 --> 00:46:56,500
in 1879, encountering antagonism

838
00:46:56,533 --> 00:47:00,067
and lack of cooperation by government officials,

839
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,267
Quakers withdrew from government sponsored work

840
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,367
and instead directed their efforts

841
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:07,700
toward establishing Quaker meetings,

842
00:47:07,733 --> 00:47:11,133
building and staffing schools on reservations,

843
00:47:11,167 --> 00:47:15,367
and maintaining relationships that continue today.

844
00:47:19,233 --> 00:47:28,767
[music]

845
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:32,367
narrator: in 1896, when there were rumors of war

846
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:35,767
between the united states and great britain, murray shipley,

847
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:39,767
one of three recorded ministers at cincinnati friends meeting,

848
00:47:39,800 --> 00:47:43,600
along with william h. taylor and anna m. johnson,

849
00:47:43,633 --> 00:47:45,100
thought it provided:

850
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:49,133
murray: a great opportunity to proclaim

851
00:47:49,167 --> 00:47:52,433
the principles of our society in opposition to all war,

852
00:47:52,467 --> 00:47:54,633
and our advocacy of peaceful means

853
00:47:54,667 --> 00:47:57,400
of adjusting all international difficulties.

854
00:47:57,433 --> 00:48:00,367
murray shipley, 1896.

855
00:48:00,400 --> 00:48:03,600
narrator: and he added that the aim of the friends was:

856
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,633
murray: not to translate christ's teachings

857
00:48:06,667 --> 00:48:09,767
into a free rendering adapted to the customs of the day,

858
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:11,700
but to uphold his standard

859
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:16,667
and let the world become not only anti-slavery, but anti-war.

860
00:48:16,700 --> 00:48:21,467
narrator: this optimistic 19th century hope was short lived.

861
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:25,100
instead, in the next century, Quakers everywhere

862
00:48:25,133 --> 00:48:27,433
found themselves repeatedly challenged

863
00:48:27,467 --> 00:48:29,567
to uphold the peace testimony

864
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,033
with its underpinnings of equality, truth and simplicity.

865
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:41,700
paul: war breaks out in 1914 in england first.

866
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:45,167
there's a problem because friends in england,

867
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:48,667
Quakers in england are clear that they are pacifists.

868
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,267
what they do in england is to establish

869
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:57,233
the friends ambulance service, which was a medical corps,

870
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,133
independent of the army.

871
00:48:59,167 --> 00:49:03,333
young men, principally Quakers but not exclusively Quakers,

872
00:49:03,367 --> 00:49:06,767
who would volunteer to drive ambulances

873
00:49:06,800 --> 00:49:09,533
and serve as medics at the front.

874
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:13,567
donne: so rufus jones and james babbitt and henry cadbury

875
00:49:13,600 --> 00:49:16,100
and some other Quaker leaders at the time,

876
00:49:16,133 --> 00:49:18,800
decided that they needed a similar organization

877
00:49:18,833 --> 00:49:23,567
for american Quakers so that they could do something,

878
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:29,167
so they could serve without serving in the military's way.

879
00:49:29,600 --> 00:49:32,367
narrator: it was then, in 1917,

880
00:49:32,400 --> 00:49:36,767
that the american friends service committee, or afsc,

881
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:39,300
was formed, to feed, clothe,

882
00:49:39,333 --> 00:49:42,033
and provide aid to the victims of war.

883
00:49:43,533 --> 00:49:45,233
ruth: if you look at the uniforms

884
00:49:45,267 --> 00:49:50,200
they looked exactly like the uniforms

885
00:49:50,233 --> 00:49:53,500
that the american military were wearing in that conflict,

886
00:49:53,533 --> 00:49:56,100
and that was because they were actually buying

887
00:49:56,133 --> 00:49:58,800
surplus army uniforms,

888
00:49:58,833 --> 00:50:02,733
and outfitting these young men in this.

889
00:50:02,767 --> 00:50:07,167
so when you see the uniforms they have on the sleeve

890
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:11,800
the red and black star, which was adopted as the logo

891
00:50:11,833 --> 00:50:13,767
for the american friend service committee.

892
00:50:13,800 --> 00:50:17,067
donne: and there were lot of young Quakers

893
00:50:17,100 --> 00:50:20,500
and other members of peace churches like the mennonite

894
00:50:20,533 --> 00:50:23,667
and the church of the brethren who did not want to go fight.

895
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:27,433
they were willing to serve, they were willing to die,

896
00:50:27,467 --> 00:50:30,200
but they didn't, they couldn't kill.

897
00:50:30,233 --> 00:50:33,367
so while there were bombs still falling in france,

898
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:37,133
american Quakers and british Quakers

899
00:50:37,167 --> 00:50:39,133
were rebuilding farmhouses

900
00:50:39,167 --> 00:50:42,700
and helping the people whose whole towns had been destroyed.

901
00:50:42,733 --> 00:50:45,167
Quakers went in there and were rebuilding,

902
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:48,133
even as the destruction was still happening.

903
00:50:48,167 --> 00:50:49,667
narrator: one of those devoted members

904
00:50:49,700 --> 00:50:52,267
of the american friends service committee

905
00:50:52,300 --> 00:50:56,200
was wilmington, ohio native, luther warren.

906
00:50:56,233 --> 00:51:00,500
ruth: luther warren tells this amazing powerful story

907
00:51:00,533 --> 00:51:03,667
about spending the day with this french family

908
00:51:03,700 --> 00:51:06,600
and at this point, all that is left of this family

909
00:51:06,633 --> 00:51:10,567
is grandma, mom, and a little girl,

910
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:14,267
and so luther and a couple of his partners

911
00:51:14,300 --> 00:51:17,567
are working together to build this home for this family.

912
00:51:17,600 --> 00:51:20,367
they are so grateful to have this home,

913
00:51:20,400 --> 00:51:22,167
to have a roof over their heads again.

914
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:26,067
luther and the men leave to go back to their camp

915
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:27,667
and find out first thing in the morning

916
00:51:27,700 --> 00:51:29,600
that the battle lines have shifted

917
00:51:29,633 --> 00:51:32,267
and so they have to go back to this same family

918
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:36,233
and evacuate them from this home that they just built.

919
00:51:37,767 --> 00:51:41,300
what's really amazing about this story is luther warren,

920
00:51:41,333 --> 00:51:44,367
maynard mckay, mark mcmillan

921
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:47,167
all of these young men from this area

922
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:51,700
they're having, first of all, these cultural experiences

923
00:51:51,733 --> 00:51:55,700
that farm boys from southwest ohio

924
00:51:55,733 --> 00:51:58,500
have never had before.

925
00:51:58,533 --> 00:52:01,367
but to think about the courage that it took,

926
00:52:01,400 --> 00:52:04,067
to say "no, I don't believe that that is something

927
00:52:04,100 --> 00:52:05,267
"that I can participate in

928
00:52:05,300 --> 00:52:08,233
and so this is what I am going to choose to do instead."

929
00:52:08,267 --> 00:52:12,233
and then to know that they were in just as much danger

930
00:52:12,267 --> 00:52:17,233
as the young man who were carrying rifles.

931
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:19,167
neil: some of them worked as medics

932
00:52:19,200 --> 00:52:22,067
or in the hospitals, that and other functions,

933
00:52:22,100 --> 00:52:26,100
but hospital work, and this was common to work with refugees

934
00:52:26,133 --> 00:52:29,533
and children and young mothers,

935
00:52:29,567 --> 00:52:33,500
a kind of focus on that kind of relief.

936
00:52:33,533 --> 00:52:37,267
I like this combination: trying to make changes

937
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:40,700
that will have long term and broad effects

938
00:52:40,733 --> 00:52:43,700
the american friend service committee has done that.

939
00:52:43,733 --> 00:52:46,300
narrator: according to wallace t. collett,

940
00:52:46,333 --> 00:52:47,467
who served as chairman

941
00:52:47,500 --> 00:52:51,167
of the american friends service committee in the 1970s,

942
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:54,167
its organizers in 1917

943
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:57,500
were inspired by a quotation from william penn:

944
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,767
william: let us then try what love will do;

945
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:03,133
for if men did once see we love them,

946
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:05,467
we should soon find they would not harm us.

947
00:53:07,133 --> 00:53:10,800
narrator: though the great war came to a close in 1918,

948
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:15,367
the work of the american friends service committee continued.

949
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:17,767
ruth: something close to a million children a day

950
00:53:17,800 --> 00:53:19,600
for a number of years,

951
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:23,767
were being fed by this relief work in europe.

952
00:53:23,800 --> 00:53:27,700
that work had a powerful legacy

953
00:53:27,733 --> 00:53:30,067
because they weren't just feeding french children,

954
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,800
they were feeding german children as well.

955
00:53:31,833 --> 00:53:35,033
they were feeding anyone who needed to be fed.

956
00:53:35,067 --> 00:53:40,767
there is a man named joe volk, who, for a number of years,

957
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:42,467
was the executive secretary

958
00:53:42,500 --> 00:53:44,767
of the friend's committee on national legislation.

959
00:53:44,800 --> 00:53:50,100
in the 1970s and 1980s he was traveling in germany,

960
00:53:50,133 --> 00:53:53,133
and they were working on east-west relations

961
00:53:53,167 --> 00:53:56,067
and anti-nuclear weapons work,

962
00:53:56,100 --> 00:53:59,467
but he was talking with some officials

963
00:53:59,500 --> 00:54:01,600
high up in the german government.

964
00:54:01,633 --> 00:54:06,400
and at some point was just kind of really personally amazed

965
00:54:06,433 --> 00:54:09,533
that these people were so willing and open

966
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:10,800
to talk with him,

967
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:14,200
when they weren't willing and open to talk with other people

968
00:54:14,233 --> 00:54:17,267
and so he finally asked somebody, what is it?

969
00:54:17,300 --> 00:54:18,667
why me?
why us?

970
00:54:18,700 --> 00:54:19,933
why the american friend service committee?

971
00:54:19,967 --> 00:54:23,633
why are you talking to us and you wont talk to anyone else?

972
00:54:23,667 --> 00:54:27,267
and this german official said because I wouldn't be here

973
00:54:27,300 --> 00:54:31,667
if you hadn't fed my parents.

974
00:54:31,700 --> 00:54:35,467
and so we are talking about a generation after, right,

975
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:39,233
this guy's parents had been fed by Quakers

976
00:54:39,267 --> 00:54:42,133
in the years after world war i.

977
00:54:42,167 --> 00:54:46,200
so we think a lot and we hear a lot about the ripple effects

978
00:54:46,233 --> 00:54:47,667
of conflict after the conflict is over,

979
00:54:47,700 --> 00:54:51,400
but to think about the ripple effects of humanitarian aid

980
00:54:51,433 --> 00:54:57,100
and of peace work generations after that's happened

981
00:54:57,133 --> 00:55:01,600
and I think that's a story that doesn't get told enough.

982
00:55:03,700 --> 00:55:14,467
[music]

983
00:55:14,500 --> 00:55:18,767
narrator: by 1940, it was clear that another major conflict

984
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:20,567
was brewing in europe.

985
00:55:35,367 --> 00:55:38,633
robert jones, minister of cincinnati friends meeting,

986
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:42,033
attended a gathering in richmond, indiana,

987
00:55:42,067 --> 00:55:44,667
"for the purpose of,"
as they explained,

988
00:55:44,700 --> 00:55:49,367
"discussing what friends can do in this world of confusion."

989
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:52,533
he reported that the american friends service committee

990
00:55:52,567 --> 00:55:55,100
was trying to work out, with the government,

991
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:58,767
some sort of service for the conscientious objectors,

992
00:55:58,800 --> 00:56:00,800
should war come.

993
00:56:00,833 --> 00:56:04,533
the result was "the selective training and service act,

994
00:56:04,567 --> 00:56:09,400
which, included an exemption from combat for any person "who,

995
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:12,267
"by reason of religious training and belief,

996
00:56:12,300 --> 00:56:13,800
"is conscientiously opposed

997
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:17,667
to participation in war in any form."

998
00:56:17,700 --> 00:56:19,433
thomas: during world war ii,

999
00:56:19,467 --> 00:56:24,467
federal law restricted the alternative service

1000
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:26,500
of conscientious objectors

1001
00:56:26,533 --> 00:56:29,667
to projects within the united states.

1002
00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:33,300
so you saw conscientious objectors

1003
00:56:33,333 --> 00:56:38,067
who worked as attendants in mental hospitals,

1004
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,800
who worked in forestry camps

1005
00:56:40,833 --> 00:56:44,167
doing conservation or fire-fighting work.

1006
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:46,800
some of the bravest conscientious objectors

1007
00:56:46,833 --> 00:56:51,800
volunteered to be guinea pigs in medical experiments,

1008
00:56:51,833 --> 00:56:55,333
testing vaccines for various diseases

1009
00:56:55,367 --> 00:56:59,400
or even taking part in starvation experiments

1010
00:56:59,433 --> 00:57:02,667
that were aimed at getting a better understanding

1011
00:57:02,700 --> 00:57:05,400
of how former pows

1012
00:57:05,433 --> 00:57:10,300
or concentration camp survivors could be nursed back to health.

1013
00:57:10,333 --> 00:57:13,500
so they were brave in their own way.

1014
00:57:13,533 --> 00:57:15,333
narrator: several Quakers from the midwest

1015
00:57:15,367 --> 00:57:18,733
took part in these dangerous experiments.

1016
00:57:18,767 --> 00:57:20,033
donne: wayne overmeyer

1017
00:57:20,067 --> 00:57:22,100
participated as human guinea pigs

1018
00:57:22,133 --> 00:57:23,700
in some of these experiments

1019
00:57:23,733 --> 00:57:25,567
in world war ii.

1020
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:30,200
david stoffregen was the first Quaker in cincinnati to register

1021
00:57:30,233 --> 00:57:34,567
as a co for that war and to sign up for the cps camps.

1022
00:57:35,800 --> 00:57:39,400
narrator: another young Quaker by the name of t. canby jones,

1023
00:57:39,433 --> 00:57:43,433
was also a co during world war ii.

1024
00:57:43,467 --> 00:57:46,533
neil: canby is very, very interesting fellow,

1025
00:57:46,567 --> 00:57:48,400
a phd from yale.

1026
00:57:48,433 --> 00:57:54,767
he was a conscientious objector and worked with the cos

1027
00:57:54,800 --> 00:58:00,400
in norway as well as some places here in the united states

1028
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:04,133
and he's also a biblical scholar.

1029
00:58:04,167 --> 00:58:08,067
he was born in japan, his father was a missionary.

1030
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:13,133
his father became the principal or president

1031
00:58:13,167 --> 00:58:16,767
of a black university in the south where he was raised

1032
00:58:16,800 --> 00:58:21,200
so he's always been on cutting edge in many different ways.

1033
00:58:21,233 --> 00:58:24,233
narrator: canby later became a beloved professor

1034
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:27,667
and peace activist at wilmington college in ohio,

1035
00:58:27,700 --> 00:58:30,467
where he was known on campus as "mr. Quaker."

1036
00:58:34,300 --> 00:58:37,267
barred from sending relief workers to battle zones

1037
00:58:37,300 --> 00:58:39,267
during wwii,

1038
00:58:39,300 --> 00:58:40,733
one wartime concern

1039
00:58:40,767 --> 00:58:43,433
the american friends service committee addressed

1040
00:58:43,467 --> 00:58:45,200
was the plight of more than

1041
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:50,100
120,000 japanese americans arrested on the suspicion

1042
00:58:50,133 --> 00:58:52,200
of being "enemy aliens"

1043
00:58:52,233 --> 00:58:57,667
after pearl harbor was attacked in 1941.

1044
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:02,267
entire families were imprisoned in temporary internment camps,

1045
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:05,500
until they could be "relocated"
from the west coast

1046
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:10,567
by the newly created wra or "war relocation authority."

1047
00:59:12,067 --> 00:59:16,633
sabrina: within 48 hours of the bombing of pearl harbor

1048
00:59:16,667 --> 00:59:20,667
president roosevelt issued an executive order,

1049
00:59:20,700 --> 00:59:25,367
that basically rounded up hundreds of japanese americans

1050
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:28,733
that lived on the west coast, and put them in internment camps

1051
00:59:28,767 --> 00:59:32,133
identifying them as enemy aliens.

1052
00:59:32,167 --> 00:59:35,600
they had to sell their farmlands,

1053
00:59:35,633 --> 00:59:37,467
close their businesses,

1054
00:59:37,500 --> 00:59:38,433
and they went to these camps

1055
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:42,333
literally with only what they could carry.

1056
00:59:42,367 --> 00:59:44,433
they were told that that they had to stay there,

1057
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:48,067
until the military order was lifted,

1058
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,400
or rescinded, or modified.

1059
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:53,633
g. raymond booth was a former Quaker pastor,

1060
00:59:53,667 --> 00:59:58,633
and had been a former executive secretary of the pacific coast

1061
00:59:58,667 --> 01:00:01,467
division of american friends service committee.

1062
01:00:01,500 --> 01:00:06,300
he was the first representative of the wra here in cincinnati

1063
01:00:06,333 --> 01:00:08,667
and met with members of cincinnati friends meeting,

1064
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:10,700
to discuss his concerns

1065
01:00:10,733 --> 01:00:14,600
for helping japanese americans get settled.

1066
01:00:14,633 --> 01:00:18,633
narrator: in response, a hostel was established--

1067
01:00:18,667 --> 01:00:21,333
temporary quarters-- where japanese americans

1068
01:00:21,367 --> 01:00:23,367
could stay until employment

1069
01:00:23,400 --> 01:00:27,233
and more permanent living arrangements could be found.

1070
01:00:27,267 --> 01:00:29,700
a university of cincinnati dormitory

1071
01:00:29,733 --> 01:00:32,467
was leased for use as the hostel.

1072
01:00:32,500 --> 01:00:35,200
and booth led by example,

1073
01:00:35,233 --> 01:00:37,567
hiring the first internment camp member

1074
01:00:37,600 --> 01:00:42,533
to relocate to cincinnati, his secretary, elva shinozaki.

1075
01:00:43,667 --> 01:00:47,267
sabrina: cincinnati friends were greatly involved in this,

1076
01:00:47,300 --> 01:00:49,333
they would coordinate picnics

1077
01:00:49,367 --> 01:00:52,133
with the young japanese americans.

1078
01:00:52,167 --> 01:00:55,300
they invited them to come to worship

1079
01:00:55,333 --> 01:00:59,267
and about 700 individuals

1080
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:03,600
took advantage of the services offered through the hostel.

1081
01:01:03,633 --> 01:01:08,267
several people who lived there felt welcomed enough

1082
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:12,433
by cincinnati friends that they just decided to join the meeting

1083
01:01:12,467 --> 01:01:14,700
to become Quakers themselves.

1084
01:01:14,733 --> 01:01:16,567
narrator: after the hostel closed,

1085
01:01:16,600 --> 01:01:19,567
cincinnati Quakers continued their relationship

1086
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:20,767
with the japanese,

1087
01:01:20,800 --> 01:01:25,167
contributing funds to rebuild a friends school in japan

1088
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:28,600
which had been destroyed by bombs.

1089
01:01:28,633 --> 01:01:32,033
meanwhile, as it had after wwi,

1090
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:35,633
at the end of wwii the american friends service committee

1091
01:01:35,667 --> 01:01:39,267
sent relief workers to help rebuild europe.

1092
01:01:39,300 --> 01:01:44,067
one young Quaker who joined that effort was robert "bob" mccoy

1093
01:01:44,100 --> 01:01:48,233
who grew up on a farm in southwestern ohio.

1094
01:01:48,267 --> 01:01:51,333
donne: then american friends service committee went over

1095
01:01:51,367 --> 01:01:55,333
to war-torn europe and began doing the work

1096
01:01:55,367 --> 01:01:58,633
of feeding the starving people who were there,

1097
01:01:58,667 --> 01:02:03,100
both german and austrian and russian.

1098
01:02:03,133 --> 01:02:06,467
I mean, they didn't just go feed the children of allies,

1099
01:02:06,500 --> 01:02:11,133
but they fed the children of the enemies.

1100
01:02:11,167 --> 01:02:16,467
and bob mccoy worked there for about four years after the war.

1101
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:19,167
narrator: one day, while out driving a truck,

1102
01:02:19,200 --> 01:02:22,667
bob's work partner had quite a memorable experience

1103
01:02:22,700 --> 01:02:25,100
with a local villager.

1104
01:02:25,133 --> 01:02:27,200
donne: as he went along from village to village,

1105
01:02:27,233 --> 01:02:29,233
he would stop and pick up people if they were walking

1106
01:02:29,267 --> 01:02:31,467
and it looked like he had room,

1107
01:02:31,500 --> 01:02:33,633
and so he picked up this elderly man,

1108
01:02:33,667 --> 01:02:36,033
gave him a ride to the next village,

1109
01:02:36,067 --> 01:02:39,267
and the old man came in on the side of the truck and asked,

1110
01:02:39,300 --> 01:02:41,100
"how much do I owe you?"

1111
01:02:41,133 --> 01:02:45,100
and the guy, the american friends service committee fellow

1112
01:02:45,133 --> 01:02:47,200
said "nothing, this is what we do;

1113
01:02:47,233 --> 01:02:49,100
you know, we are here to help."

1114
01:02:49,133 --> 01:02:52,200
and the old man glanced up and he saw the Quakers insignia,

1115
01:02:52,233 --> 01:02:56,600
and he said, "ah, Quakers, that explains everything."

1116
01:02:56,633 --> 01:02:58,300
that was left over because

1117
01:02:58,333 --> 01:03:01,433
they remembered what Quakers had done in world war i.

1118
01:03:01,467 --> 01:03:06,400
and that makes me think about that saying from william penn,

1119
01:03:06,433 --> 01:03:08,800
"let us then try what love will do,"

1120
01:03:08,833 --> 01:03:15,633
and I think love given freely during and after world war i

1121
01:03:15,667 --> 01:03:17,667
was remembered 50
and 60 years later

1122
01:03:17,700 --> 01:03:22,600
and had an impact 50 or 60 years later on your enemies.

1123
01:03:22,633 --> 01:03:26,733
I mean that's such a powerful lesson,

1124
01:03:26,767 --> 01:03:33,700
and it gives credence and weight to the teachings of christianity

1125
01:03:33,733 --> 01:03:35,667
and of Quakerism.

1126
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:38,300
paul: after the war in recognition of this,

1127
01:03:38,333 --> 01:03:40,067
friends service committee in england

1128
01:03:40,100 --> 01:03:42,233
and the american friends service committee

1129
01:03:42,267 --> 01:03:45,033
are awarded a nobel peace prize.

1130
01:03:45,067 --> 01:03:52,100
it's international recognition of the alternative to warfare,

1131
01:03:52,133 --> 01:03:55,733
that Quakers in their best sense, represent.

1132
01:03:59,567 --> 01:04:09,400
[music]

1133
01:04:09,433 --> 01:04:11,367
narrator: over the next three decades

1134
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,733
the social and political focus of americans

1135
01:04:13,767 --> 01:04:15,000
and much of the world,

1136
01:04:15,033 --> 01:04:18,467
shifted from europe to the growing civil rights movement

1137
01:04:18,500 --> 01:04:21,533
within the united states.

1138
01:04:21,567 --> 01:04:26,267
in 1954, five black parents in hillsboro, ohio

1139
01:04:26,300 --> 01:04:29,200
brought a lawsuit against the local school board

1140
01:04:29,233 --> 01:04:33,067
for its policy of segregation in the schools.

1141
01:04:33,100 --> 01:04:36,800
in its ruling on brown vs. the board of education

1142
01:04:36,833 --> 01:04:40,367
earlier that year, the u.s. supreme court had

1143
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:44,167
"abolished the 'separate but equal' rule under which

1144
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:48,167
"hillsboro's african american children had been educated

1145
01:04:48,200 --> 01:04:51,100
in segregated schools for decades."

1146
01:04:51,133 --> 01:04:56,100
the naacp helped provide legal counsel in the hillsboro suit.

1147
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:58,567
"thurgood marshall, who successfully argued

1148
01:04:58,600 --> 01:05:02,600
"the brown case, wrote the briefs and signed the petition

1149
01:05:02,633 --> 01:05:06,733
submitted to the district court in cincinnati."

1150
01:05:06,767 --> 01:05:09,167
one of the parents, imogene curtis,

1151
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:11,100
approached local Quaker meetings

1152
01:05:11,133 --> 01:05:13,333
in nearby leesburg and wilmington,

1153
01:05:13,367 --> 01:05:15,267
and requested their help.

1154
01:05:15,300 --> 01:05:18,700
this was how the freedom schools of hillsboro, ohio,

1155
01:05:18,733 --> 01:05:22,067
also known as the
"kitchen schools" began.

1156
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:26,133
rebecca Godfrey's mother was involved with the effort.

1157
01:05:26,167 --> 01:05:27,600
rebecca: my dad happened to be serving

1158
01:05:27,633 --> 01:05:31,133
on a committee at the time for the yearly meeting

1159
01:05:31,167 --> 01:05:35,033
that received the request.

1160
01:05:35,067 --> 01:05:36,767
he came home and he informed her

1161
01:05:36,800 --> 01:05:41,233
that he had volunteered her to go to hillsboro once a week

1162
01:05:41,267 --> 01:05:45,167
and help with the schooling of these children.

1163
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:49,367
so the group of Quaker teachers--

1164
01:05:49,400 --> 01:05:51,500
there were four of them--

1165
01:05:51,533 --> 01:05:54,733
would go to hillsboro on mondays,

1166
01:05:54,767 --> 01:06:00,633
and meet, and work with the children on that day.

1167
01:06:00,667 --> 01:06:03,167
and then, they would leave lesson plans

1168
01:06:03,200 --> 01:06:08,033
for the mother teachers to carry out

1169
01:06:08,067 --> 01:06:09,667
for the rest of the week.

1170
01:06:09,700 --> 01:06:12,767
and that's how they became known as the kitchen schools

1171
01:06:12,800 --> 01:06:13,933
because a lot of them,

1172
01:06:13,967 --> 01:06:16,633
they sat around a kitchen table four or five children.

1173
01:06:18,367 --> 01:06:21,267
narrator: during that, lifelong bonds were established

1174
01:06:21,300 --> 01:06:25,367
between the black parents and the Quaker teachers.

1175
01:06:25,400 --> 01:06:32,700
rebecca: I was at a family reunion with my teenage son

1176
01:06:32,733 --> 01:06:36,200
who invited his friend to come.

1177
01:06:36,233 --> 01:06:40,333
and his friend is biracial

1178
01:06:40,367 --> 01:06:46,700
and I said, "do you have any relations in hillsboro?"

1179
01:06:46,733 --> 01:06:49,600
and he goes "i think so.

1180
01:06:49,633 --> 01:06:50,700
I think my--"

1181
01:06:50,733 --> 01:06:53,667
I said, "imogene and orville curtis, by any chance?"

1182
01:06:53,700 --> 01:06:57,200
and he says, "well, my dad was orville curtis

1183
01:06:57,233 --> 01:06:59,067
"and he was named after his uncle.

1184
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,700
I think that they lived in hillsboro".

1185
01:07:01,733 --> 01:07:07,167
and so, here, you know, my mom had worked with ms. imogene

1186
01:07:07,200 --> 01:07:10,500
in the kitchen schools and two generations later

1187
01:07:10,533 --> 01:07:14,733
her grandson and orville curtis,

1188
01:07:14,767 --> 01:07:19,633
her husband's great nephew are best friends.

1189
01:07:19,667 --> 01:07:20,767
you know, it makes you kind of proud

1190
01:07:20,800 --> 01:07:22,533
that your mom had a part in that.

1191
01:07:27,167 --> 01:07:35,733
[music]

1192
01:07:35,767 --> 01:07:38,133
narrator: when american involvement in the conflict

1193
01:07:38,167 --> 01:07:42,533
in southeast asia escalated, so did Quaker concern.

1194
01:07:42,567 --> 01:07:45,567
friends everywhere protested the war.

1195
01:07:45,600 --> 01:07:47,133
wilmington college,

1196
01:07:47,167 --> 01:07:49,300
under the leadership of Quaker presidents,

1197
01:07:49,333 --> 01:07:52,433
became a focus of Quaker activism.

1198
01:07:52,467 --> 01:07:56,167
gary kersey, a graduate of wilmington college,

1199
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,233
recounts his time at the school

1200
01:07:58,267 --> 01:08:01,300
during the peak of demonstrations.

1201
01:08:01,333 --> 01:08:08,733
gary: I saw these demonstrations starting to unfold.

1202
01:08:08,767 --> 01:08:14,233
I remember there were those who opposed the war

1203
01:08:14,267 --> 01:08:17,233
kind of lining up on one side of the sidewalk

1204
01:08:17,267 --> 01:08:21,133
and those who were in support of the troops

1205
01:08:21,167 --> 01:08:22,733
were on the other side.

1206
01:08:22,767 --> 01:08:25,033
and I thought to myself,

1207
01:08:25,067 --> 01:08:31,500
you know, I can go back down the back stairs of college hall,

1208
01:08:31,533 --> 01:08:33,667
get in my cougar and go to hardy's

1209
01:08:33,700 --> 01:08:37,200
and avoid this whole dilemma

1210
01:08:37,233 --> 01:08:39,767
as to whether i'm going to be a part of this,

1211
01:08:39,800 --> 01:08:41,733
whether i'm going to be for the war

1212
01:08:41,767 --> 01:08:46,233
or shall we say against the war.

1213
01:08:46,267 --> 01:08:52,267
and I must say that I think I had reached the point in my life

1214
01:08:52,300 --> 01:08:56,167
that up 'till that time,

1215
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:59,067
most everybody had been telling me what I ought to do

1216
01:08:59,100 --> 01:09:03,500
and what I ought to say and what I ought to feel.

1217
01:09:03,533 --> 01:09:05,533
I had a lot of good teachers.

1218
01:09:05,567 --> 01:09:08,033
I have wonderful parents,

1219
01:09:08,067 --> 01:09:10,300
had a lot of good people telling me what to do.

1220
01:09:10,333 --> 01:09:12,633
but here was a case

1221
01:09:12,667 --> 01:09:17,300
where I was going to have to make this decision myself.

1222
01:09:17,333 --> 01:09:19,300
and I think there's a lot of people out there

1223
01:09:19,333 --> 01:09:21,767
that maybe have a certain feeling

1224
01:09:21,800 --> 01:09:24,200
but they just don't capture that feeling

1225
01:09:24,233 --> 01:09:27,100
because they're afraid of what people will think

1226
01:09:27,133 --> 01:09:30,533
that they're not, you know, it's not what it's all about.

1227
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:33,633
narrator: though many people struggled

1228
01:09:33,667 --> 01:09:36,633
with how to respond to the war, wilmington college professor,

1229
01:09:36,667 --> 01:09:40,467
larry gara and his wife lenna mae did not.

1230
01:09:40,500 --> 01:09:43,600
the gara's were involved in a plethora of vigils

1231
01:09:43,633 --> 01:09:46,333
and demonstrations during the vietnam war

1232
01:09:46,367 --> 01:09:48,500
and were quite familiar with the consequences

1233
01:09:48,533 --> 01:09:51,200
of acting upon their beliefs.

1234
01:09:51,233 --> 01:09:54,267
larry served multiple prison sentences

1235
01:09:54,300 --> 01:09:56,267
for his challenges to the system,

1236
01:09:56,300 --> 01:09:59,633
beginning during world war ii.

1237
01:09:59,667 --> 01:10:03,600
larry: I was only arrested once during vietnam.

1238
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:07,067
I don't take civil disobedience lightly.

1239
01:10:07,100 --> 01:10:10,167
and in 1942 when I was supposed to register

1240
01:10:10,200 --> 01:10:13,100
I couldn't do anything else;
it was a matter of conscience.

1241
01:10:13,133 --> 01:10:16,567
I publicly announced that I could not,

1242
01:10:16,600 --> 01:10:21,533
in good conscience, register and of course when I did that,

1243
01:10:21,567 --> 01:10:23,533
when I was 20 years old,

1244
01:10:23,567 --> 01:10:28,567
I was sentenced to prison for three years.

1245
01:10:29,533 --> 01:10:32,367
narrator: years later, accused of counseling a student

1246
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:35,067
to refuse to register for the draft,

1247
01:10:35,100 --> 01:10:38,300
gara was sentenced to prison for another 18 months,

1248
01:10:38,333 --> 01:10:41,567
separating him from his wife lenna mae.

1249
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:48,467
lenna mae: we had been married for about five or six years then

1250
01:10:48,500 --> 01:10:52,100
and that was kind of difficult, very difficult,

1251
01:10:52,133 --> 01:10:54,300
but I was young, he was young,

1252
01:10:54,333 --> 01:10:56,033
we were healthy, and we got through it.

1253
01:10:56,067 --> 01:10:58,267
larry: i've regret a lot of things i've done

1254
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:00,700
but I never regretted refusing to register.

1255
01:11:00,733 --> 01:11:03,367
I think it was absolutely the right thing to do

1256
01:11:03,400 --> 01:11:05,133
and still feel that way.

1257
01:11:06,667 --> 01:11:08,667
narrator: throughout the vietnam war,

1258
01:11:08,700 --> 01:11:11,567
Quakers everywhere held peace vigils,

1259
01:11:11,600 --> 01:11:16,267
and in may 1970, cincinnati and wilmington friends

1260
01:11:16,300 --> 01:11:20,033
joined other religious groups in protesting the killing

1261
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:23,067
of four kent state university students

1262
01:11:23,100 --> 01:11:25,633
by the ohio national guard.

1263
01:11:25,667 --> 01:11:29,300
current cincinnati friends member, jim crocker-lakness,

1264
01:11:29,333 --> 01:11:31,433
was a student at kent state.

1265
01:11:31,467 --> 01:11:34,433
he remembers that morning.

1266
01:11:34,467 --> 01:11:38,067
jim: the guard moved into the fenced in area

1267
01:11:38,100 --> 01:11:40,733
and found themselves blocked, couldn't move.

1268
01:11:40,767 --> 01:11:45,433
so there was a moment of back and forth between,

1269
01:11:45,467 --> 01:11:48,767
about eight to ten of us, in the parking lot.

1270
01:11:48,800 --> 01:11:54,100
the national guard would shoot their tear gas

1271
01:11:54,133 --> 01:11:59,300
and we were able to run down wind of the tear gas

1272
01:11:59,333 --> 01:12:02,100
and pick it up and throw it back.

1273
01:12:02,133 --> 01:12:09,033
and then I found myself-- I had picked up a rock

1274
01:12:09,067 --> 01:12:15,700
and I found my arm cocked ready to throw this rock

1275
01:12:15,733 --> 01:12:22,400
and time stood still.

1276
01:12:22,433 --> 01:12:31,167
the universe vanished and I heard jesus say,

1277
01:12:31,200 --> 01:12:34,667
"jim are you sure you want to do that?

1278
01:12:34,700 --> 01:12:38,733
drop that rock and follow me."

1279
01:12:38,767 --> 01:12:43,500
and so my conscientious objection to war

1280
01:12:43,533 --> 01:12:48,100
and non-violence based on the teachings of jesus,

1281
01:12:48,133 --> 01:12:50,067
came back to me and I did drop the rock.

1282
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,700
narrator: another influential Quaker actively involved

1283
01:12:54,733 --> 01:12:58,667
in following the peace testimony was wallace collett,

1284
01:12:58,700 --> 01:13:03,667
a wwii conscientious objector from wilmington, ohio.

1285
01:13:03,700 --> 01:13:06,200
after graduating from wilmington college,

1286
01:13:06,233 --> 01:13:08,067
collett moved to cincinnati,

1287
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:12,167
where he became a prominent businessman and civic leader.

1288
01:13:12,200 --> 01:13:14,433
and eventually became chairman

1289
01:13:14,467 --> 01:13:18,167
of the american friends service committee.

1290
01:13:18,200 --> 01:13:20,733
paul: wallace was upfront,

1291
01:13:20,767 --> 01:13:24,800
out in the open with his war tax resistance.

1292
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:28,567
every year he would fill out his 1040

1293
01:13:28,600 --> 01:13:33,500
and he'd get to the bottom and he'd write a note

1294
01:13:33,533 --> 01:13:41,267
and attach it, telling the irs that he had not paid x dollars

1295
01:13:41,300 --> 01:13:44,233
because he considered them to be dollars

1296
01:13:44,267 --> 01:13:48,800
that supported the military.

1297
01:13:48,833 --> 01:13:52,767
but then he went on and he would tell them

1298
01:13:52,800 --> 01:13:56,400
"i have deposited that amount of money

1299
01:13:56,433 --> 01:14:00,533
"plus whatever you know
10% for the penalties

1300
01:14:00,567 --> 01:14:03,100
"that I know you are going to assess

1301
01:14:03,133 --> 01:14:05,100
"plus any interest that might be due.

1302
01:14:05,133 --> 01:14:07,033
I put it all in this bank account."

1303
01:14:07,067 --> 01:14:10,767
he'd give them the bank name and the account number

1304
01:14:10,800 --> 01:14:13,133
so they could go and get that money.

1305
01:14:13,167 --> 01:14:15,133
so he was going to resist the taxes.

1306
01:14:15,167 --> 01:14:17,600
he knew that they were going to want it

1307
01:14:17,633 --> 01:14:20,400
and he wasn't gonna try to stop them from getting it.

1308
01:14:20,433 --> 01:14:24,533
in fact he ended up paying more because he knew they were

1309
01:14:24,567 --> 01:14:27,067
going to assess penalties and interest on it.

1310
01:14:27,100 --> 01:14:30,267
all that money was in the bank, but then he did something else.

1311
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:32,567
this is the good part.

1312
01:14:32,600 --> 01:14:36,767
he knew the presidents of most of the banks in cincinnati,

1313
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:39,533
maybe all the banks in cincinnati.

1314
01:14:39,567 --> 01:14:43,267
he would open an account at the bank, put the money in,

1315
01:14:43,300 --> 01:14:45,100
but then he'd make an appointment

1316
01:14:45,133 --> 01:14:48,367
with the president of the bank

1317
01:14:48,400 --> 01:14:51,733
and he would go in and he'd say, "hi al, how are you doing?

1318
01:14:51,767 --> 01:14:53,300
"it's good to see you.

1319
01:14:53,333 --> 01:14:55,667
"listen the irs is going to come

1320
01:14:55,700 --> 01:14:58,267
and they are going to seize my account."

1321
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:01,100
well, you can imagine the shock that this would cause.

1322
01:15:01,133 --> 01:15:04,667
I mean, this is a permanent person in our community

1323
01:15:04,700 --> 01:15:07,467
and he is telling me as the president of the bank

1324
01:15:07,500 --> 01:15:11,267
that they are going to come and seize his assets.

1325
01:15:11,300 --> 01:15:14,300
and so of course what do I do as the president?

1326
01:15:14,333 --> 01:15:16,800
I said why, what's going on?

1327
01:15:16,833 --> 01:15:20,733
and wallace would then have the opportunity to tell them

1328
01:15:20,767 --> 01:15:25,233
about what war taxes represented,

1329
01:15:25,267 --> 01:15:29,767
why they were wrong and what he was doing to resist them.

1330
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:35,267
it gave him an opportunity to minister to prominent people,

1331
01:15:35,300 --> 01:15:41,267
people with power and authority in the business community

1332
01:15:41,300 --> 01:15:46,433
and I just think that's just such a tremendous example

1333
01:15:46,467 --> 01:15:47,533
for all of us.

1334
01:15:48,700 --> 01:15:52,200
narrator: over the years, others like jim crocker-lakness

1335
01:15:52,233 --> 01:15:56,300
faced difficult choices related to the peace testimony.

1336
01:15:56,333 --> 01:15:59,400
such was the situation of ryan myers

1337
01:15:59,433 --> 01:16:02,600
during desert storm in 1990.

1338
01:16:02,633 --> 01:16:05,367
but after some guidance from fellow friend

1339
01:16:05,400 --> 01:16:08,533
and conscientious objector, charlie pierson,

1340
01:16:08,567 --> 01:16:12,633
myers was more confident in his decision.

1341
01:16:12,667 --> 01:16:15,433
ryan: looking at having to register for selective service,

1342
01:16:15,467 --> 01:16:17,233
that I was not going to.

1343
01:16:17,267 --> 01:16:21,167
so charlie pearson, who was a member of the meeting

1344
01:16:21,200 --> 01:16:24,200
I was a co during wwii,

1345
01:16:24,233 --> 01:16:27,300
was a bit of mentor for me when I was young.

1346
01:16:27,333 --> 01:16:29,500
I think I took some strength from that

1347
01:16:29,533 --> 01:16:33,600
knowing that, okay I know charlie and I respect charlie.

1348
01:16:33,633 --> 01:16:36,367
he was able to do it, he was okay.

1349
01:16:36,400 --> 01:16:39,333
of course, when I was making the decision

1350
01:16:39,367 --> 01:16:42,733
I knew it carried potential legal consequences.

1351
01:16:42,767 --> 01:16:45,800
the possibility of a pretty substantial fine,

1352
01:16:45,833 --> 01:16:50,533
prison time, and i'm not eligible for student loans.

1353
01:16:50,567 --> 01:16:53,267
but I think it was the right decision for me.

1354
01:16:53,300 --> 01:16:55,033
I think if the circumstances were the same

1355
01:16:55,067 --> 01:16:56,567
i'd make the decision again.

1356
01:17:00,167 --> 01:17:08,200
[music]

1357
01:17:08,233 --> 01:17:10,667
narrator: in recent years, some Quakers have,

1358
01:17:10,700 --> 01:17:12,433
as their predecessors did,

1359
01:17:12,467 --> 01:17:17,067
focused on projects to provide education equality.

1360
01:17:17,100 --> 01:17:20,067
with the support of her local friends meeting,

1361
01:17:20,100 --> 01:17:23,800
cincinnati Quaker cathy barney has put her energy

1362
01:17:23,833 --> 01:17:28,567
into an arts program for underprivileged children.

1363
01:17:28,600 --> 01:17:33,567
cathy: I started it because I just knew that there were kids

1364
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:34,600
in my neighborhood

1365
01:17:34,633 --> 01:17:36,567
that didn't have the options and opportunities

1366
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,433
that the average kid has,

1367
01:17:38,467 --> 01:17:40,633
yet these kids were just as valuable.

1368
01:17:40,667 --> 01:17:44,600
I hope to provide a safe place for these kids,

1369
01:17:44,633 --> 01:17:47,300
I hope it sparks something in them.

1370
01:17:47,333 --> 01:17:50,467
that maybe an area or opportunity would open up

1371
01:17:50,500 --> 01:17:52,133
that they hadn't seen before.

1372
01:17:54,467 --> 01:17:56,767
donovan: it's just a way to be creative

1373
01:17:56,800 --> 01:18:00,533
and get your hands dirty.

1374
01:18:00,567 --> 01:18:04,433
mckenzee: we painted stuff and we got like one of those hats

1375
01:18:04,467 --> 01:18:08,033
that the artists wear.

1376
01:18:08,067 --> 01:18:09,667
cathy: some of the kids have told me

1377
01:18:09,700 --> 01:18:11,667
they really like to come here because it gets them

1378
01:18:11,700 --> 01:18:13,767
away from the daily drama where they live.

1379
01:18:16,333 --> 01:18:19,133
angel: I keep coming back because sometimes

1380
01:18:19,167 --> 01:18:22,633
when I like have a bad day, this is the only place I can go to

1381
01:18:22,667 --> 01:18:26,300
and it like makes me feel better about myself.

1382
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:30,567
I miss cathy and miss pat and all of them teaching me

1383
01:18:30,600 --> 01:18:34,600
the important responsibilities and stuff in life.

1384
01:18:34,633 --> 01:18:38,167
cathy: I think it really gives them a voice, self expression.

1385
01:18:38,200 --> 01:18:40,667
if these kids have a venue for self expression

1386
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:41,867
then they know who they are,

1387
01:18:41,900 --> 01:18:45,633
they have a voice and they can say no to bad influences,

1388
01:18:45,667 --> 01:18:46,600
they know who they are.

1389
01:18:46,633 --> 01:18:48,067
I think it makes them stronger.

1390
01:18:50,067 --> 01:18:51,400
donovan: if I would learn something,

1391
01:18:51,433 --> 01:18:54,300
it would be how to help people

1392
01:18:54,333 --> 01:18:57,433
and teach people how to do the art stuff.

1393
01:18:57,467 --> 01:18:59,800
angel: i'm just like a different person,

1394
01:18:59,833 --> 01:19:05,233
like i'm more mature and I know how to handle situations better.

1395
01:19:05,267 --> 01:19:07,267
cathy: I think one of the Quaker principles

1396
01:19:07,300 --> 01:19:10,767
that has always spoken to me is seeing that of God in others

1397
01:19:10,800 --> 01:19:13,200
and being able to see that of God in these kids

1398
01:19:13,233 --> 01:19:15,700
and helping them to see that in themselves.

1399
01:19:15,733 --> 01:19:17,800
I mean, I think that's, sort of, in a nutshell,

1400
01:19:17,833 --> 01:19:19,200
what the whole point is.

1401
01:19:22,100 --> 01:19:24,767
narrator: also supported by cincinnati friends meeting,

1402
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:28,367
luke and angela ebner express their faith

1403
01:19:28,400 --> 01:19:31,133
through work with inner city youth,

1404
01:19:31,167 --> 01:19:34,767
exposing them to organic and sustainable gardening,

1405
01:19:34,800 --> 01:19:37,467
"planting seeds of hope."

1406
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:39,200
luke: the kids that work with us

1407
01:19:39,233 --> 01:19:42,667
get to learn how to plant plants,

1408
01:19:42,700 --> 01:19:47,733
harvest, market, cook organic fruits and vegetables

1409
01:19:47,767 --> 01:19:49,667
that are all grown right here.

1410
01:19:52,700 --> 01:19:55,567
I always say we're planting nourishing habitats

1411
01:19:55,600 --> 01:19:57,333
for our community.

1412
01:19:57,367 --> 01:20:03,200
so this is a nourishing habitat that I get to cultivate

1413
01:20:03,233 --> 01:20:07,467
with the youth that we interact with.

1414
01:20:08,400 --> 01:20:10,600
robert: living in an urban community it's really hard

1415
01:20:10,633 --> 01:20:12,667
to have that time of mediation and peace

1416
01:20:12,700 --> 01:20:14,400
because there's always so much going on.

1417
01:20:14,433 --> 01:20:16,333
and this is a highly populated area.

1418
01:20:16,367 --> 01:20:18,233
so being in a secluded area like gardening,

1419
01:20:18,267 --> 01:20:21,367
it brings you a peace that you never even knew existed.

1420
01:20:21,400 --> 01:20:24,367
and it's truly a blessing to be able to grow food

1421
01:20:24,400 --> 01:20:28,033
and to just be out because putting your hands at work

1422
01:20:28,067 --> 01:20:31,067
and really allow your mind to meditate and just flow

1423
01:20:31,100 --> 01:20:33,333
and losing yourself while being in the grass

1424
01:20:33,367 --> 01:20:35,467
or tending to the plants or whatnot

1425
01:20:35,500 --> 01:20:36,767
you really get the opportunity to think.

1426
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:44,433
rashawn: life outside the garden is much like a challenge.

1427
01:20:44,467 --> 01:20:47,067
it's much like working at the garden.

1428
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:51,333
like I said, putting forth effort to do anything you want

1429
01:20:51,367 --> 01:20:53,333
takes practice, hard work, and dedication.

1430
01:20:54,700 --> 01:20:57,167
robert: there was a time in my life when I had nowhere to go.

1431
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:59,533
and I had to come to this garden and luke gave me a job,

1432
01:20:59,567 --> 01:21:00,800
he made sure I had money in my pocket,

1433
01:21:00,833 --> 01:21:04,167
he made sure it was enough for me to help support my family.

1434
01:21:04,200 --> 01:21:06,367
this garden means everything to me, truly.

1435
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,267
what i've learned about equality while working here

1436
01:21:08,300 --> 01:21:12,033
at the eco garden is that we all are in the same boat,

1437
01:21:12,067 --> 01:21:13,433
no one is better than no one else.

1438
01:21:13,467 --> 01:21:15,300
even though someone might have better clothes

1439
01:21:15,333 --> 01:21:18,167
or might have a better career or better options

1440
01:21:18,200 --> 01:21:19,567
or opportunities, at the end of the day

1441
01:21:19,600 --> 01:21:22,567
we're all human beings with the same faults and issues.

1442
01:21:22,600 --> 01:21:25,033
at the end of the day, we're all afraid of the same things.

1443
01:21:25,067 --> 01:21:27,533
so truly there's no point in seeing anyone above you

1444
01:21:27,567 --> 01:21:29,767
or below you, there's no point of insecurity

1445
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,033
because we're all in the same boat,

1446
01:21:31,067 --> 01:21:32,200
we're all scared of the same thing,

1447
01:21:32,233 --> 01:21:33,433
we all seek the same thing.

1448
01:21:40,633 --> 01:21:43,233
narrator: public friend and minister, donne hayden,

1449
01:21:43,267 --> 01:21:46,667
believes that several things particularly attract people

1450
01:21:46,700 --> 01:21:49,533
to Quakerism: social activism

1451
01:21:49,567 --> 01:21:54,667
and the affirmation that there is "that of God in everyone"

1452
01:21:54,700 --> 01:21:56,533
which includes the understanding

1453
01:21:56,567 --> 01:22:00,600
that anyone may be led or guided by God.

1454
01:22:02,433 --> 01:22:05,267
donne: we attract people who are deeply involved

1455
01:22:05,300 --> 01:22:10,333
and socially conscious and committed to social justice.

1456
01:22:10,367 --> 01:22:14,333
but the other kind of person is a person who is tuned in

1457
01:22:14,367 --> 01:22:18,500
and listening and can hear,

1458
01:22:18,533 --> 01:22:24,367
or can be led and so finds themselves among others

1459
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,367
who are of similar leading.

1460
01:22:27,400 --> 01:22:31,267
julie: for me, for my family, that component of equality

1461
01:22:31,300 --> 01:22:35,467
has been a large piece of what has kept us here.

1462
01:22:35,500 --> 01:22:36,800
rachel: Quakerism has really helped us

1463
01:22:36,833 --> 01:22:40,100
focus ourselves outwards,

1464
01:22:40,133 --> 01:22:44,067
because you can see the effect that it has on everybody else

1465
01:22:44,100 --> 01:22:46,167
and you feel like you're contributing to society

1466
01:22:46,200 --> 01:22:47,767
and helping others.

1467
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:52,200
judy: Quakers believe that each of us has the responsibility

1468
01:22:52,233 --> 01:22:53,300
to become a minister

1469
01:22:53,333 --> 01:22:56,800
and to minister each in our own way to the community

1470
01:22:56,833 --> 01:23:00,033
and to the wider world as well.

1471
01:23:00,067 --> 01:23:06,567
jeff: my attraction to Quakerism has always been on the side

1472
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:09,667
of the experiential approach to religion,

1473
01:23:09,700 --> 01:23:14,800
that you have an immediate experience

1474
01:23:14,833 --> 01:23:17,400
of the presence of the spirit

1475
01:23:17,433 --> 01:23:24,367
and out of that grows your values and your commitments.

1476
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:34,067
rebecca: it is just discovering that you can have an actual

1477
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:41,533
one-on-one relationship with your creator and that you can

1478
01:23:41,567 --> 01:23:46,067
know the joy and the peace,

1479
01:23:46,100 --> 01:23:50,167
and the beauty that God created us to know.

1480
01:23:51,200 --> 01:23:53,567
narrator: through more than three centuries,

1481
01:23:53,600 --> 01:23:56,800
Quakers everywhere-- famous and anonymous,

1482
01:23:56,833 --> 01:24:00,267
in east coast city and midwestern countryside--

1483
01:24:00,300 --> 01:24:03,100
have heeded george fox's admonition

1484
01:24:03,133 --> 01:24:07,200
to "answer that of God in everyone."

1485
01:24:07,233 --> 01:24:10,567
thomas: if it were proper for Quakers to be proud,

1486
01:24:10,600 --> 01:24:15,167
I think we're entitled to be proud for the many ways

1487
01:24:15,200 --> 01:24:20,600
that we've worked to try to make the world a better place

1488
01:24:20,633 --> 01:24:25,033
and particularly focused on people who were marginalized

1489
01:24:25,067 --> 01:24:30,033
and disenfranchised by the larger society.

1490
01:24:30,067 --> 01:24:34,767
and I hope that's something that will always be true of friends,

1491
01:24:34,800 --> 01:24:40,433
that we will always be willing to be counter-cultural,

1492
01:24:40,467 --> 01:24:44,800
not for the sake of being odd

1493
01:24:44,833 --> 01:24:48,667
or just for the sake of being different,

1494
01:24:48,700 --> 01:24:54,133
but because by running counter to the larger culture

1495
01:24:54,167 --> 01:24:58,500
and its values, we ultimately move it toward being

1496
01:24:58,533 --> 01:25:05,033
a better, more just, more radically fair world.
