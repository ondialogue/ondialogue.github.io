1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,150
It takes a lot of patience to be in an organization this way. 

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,010
Because we do have  in us is impulse 

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,820
to control processes and quotes 'get results'. 

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,420
And the  fixing mode that a lot of consultants get into, 

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,370
looks on the surface like it's doing a better job 

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,730
of controlling processes and getting results. 

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,030
My sense is though that is often an illusion

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,470
that gets manufactured for a short period of time 

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,510
and then things revert back to the status quo. 

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,210
It takes more time in patients, 

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,950
to be in that organization or in the world, 

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,920
in an inquiry mode which helps people

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,590
see themselves in the mirror. 

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,400
But once they've seen themselves, 

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,260
the transformation is much more likely to 

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:10,039
have legs to stand, to last, to make the distance. 

20
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:14,480
There's actually a great story out of Quaker tradition 

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,340
that I'd love to tell about this. 

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,180
Because its historical fact and 

24
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,119
I think it witnesses to the point I'm trying to make. 

25
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,123
A hundred years before the Civil War was fought, 

26
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,330
there were Quakers on the East Coast 

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,170
who like everybody else owned slaves, 

28
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,101
they were farmers and you ran a farm with slaves 

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,270
that was the American economy. 

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,279
And there was among within that Quaker community, 

31
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,910
a man named John Wooloman, 

32
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:54,949
who had it as he said laid upon him by the Lord 

33
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,185
that slavery was evil and moral wrong. 

34
00:01:58,185 --> 00:01:59,620
And the Quakers,

35
00:01:59,620 --> 00:02:04,259
that God was calling Quakers to free their slaves. 

36
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,964
He took this to his local meeting, congregation. 

38
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:16,770
And they wrestled with it in open dialogue. 

39
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,190
And could not come to consensus 

40
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,079
which is what Quakers have to do, 

41
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,220
they don't take a vote,  

42
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,614
because they think voting is violent

43
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,387
 if 51% can tell 49% where to get off,

44
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:33,660
that's an act of violence.  

45
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,560
And so they labored with it trying to reach consensus 

46
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,379
but couldn't reach consensus. 

47
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,770
But they said to John Woolman,  

48
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,999
"While we don't yet have this light for ourselves,

49
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,259
we don't have any doubt 

50
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,900
that you're  seeing something very clearly, 

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,773
we just can't see it yet. 

52
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,269
And so we will support  your family  

53
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,150
while you travel among Quaker Friends 

54
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,859
up and down the East Coast, delivering your message 

55
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:07,159
sharing your revelation for as long as

56
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,590
it takes for some kind of outcome to happen.
