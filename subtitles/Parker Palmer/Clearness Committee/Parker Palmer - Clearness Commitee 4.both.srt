1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,139
就这样，伍尔曼在东海岸旅行了近20年，
And so Woolman traveled the East Coast for almost 20 years 

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:11,139
与大众分享他觉得是上帝启示
sharing what he felt had been laid upon him 

3
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,550
给他的关于奴隶制罪恶的东西。
by the Lord about the evils of slavery. 

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,383
他因穿着未染色衣服、
He was famous for appearing in 

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:23,423
纯白衣服出现于众而闻名，
for wearing undyed clothing, plain white clothing, 

6
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:27,430
因为他认为染色是奴隶劳动的产物。
because the dyned was a product of slave labor.

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,133
另外他因晚上出现在农舍而闻名，
And he was famous for showing up at a farmhouse at night 

9
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,840
如果他得知饭菜是由奴隶准备的，
and if he learned that the meal had been prepared by 

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,970
或者是由奴隶端上来的,
or if it was being served by a slave, 

11
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,610
他就会在餐桌上禁食，
he would fast while he stayed a table, 

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,010
所以他的言行都与 
so he was utterly consistent with his message

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,720
他所传达的信息完全一致。
in both his words and in his actions. 

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,700
经过20年的这种见证,
And after 20 years of this witnessing, 

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,590
伍尔曼的言行举止
this mirroring back to this holding up 

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,923
就如一面镜子
of a mirror where people could, 

17
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,050
让人们在吃由奴隶准备
while they were eating the meal  

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:01,064
或为其服务的饭菜时可以反观自照。
that a slave had prepared or served.

19
00:01:01,064 --> 00:01:04,400
伍尔曼说的是贵格会的基本信念，
Woolman was speaking of fundamental Quaker beliefs

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,330
而不是为见证作证而高谈阔论。
and not haranguing that just witnessing testify.

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,940
经过20年的努力，
After 20 years of this, 

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,280
贵格会教众达成了解放奴隶的共识。
Quakers reached consensus on freeing their slaves.

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,650
这个故事的重要意义
Now the important point in this story is 

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,409
不仅在于伍尔曼在很长一段时间内
not only the way he held up a mirror to

26
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,470
耐心地举起了让人们反观自己的镜子，
people's lives patiently over a long period of time, 

27
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,570
而且在于贵格会是美国第一个
but that Quakers were the first religious community 

28
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,759
解放奴隶的宗教团体。
in the United States to free their slaves.

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,500
而且他们在南北战争爆发前80年就这样做了。
And they did so 80 years before the Civil War was fought. 

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,470
这个故事让我提出了这样的问题：
It's a story that allows me to ask the question, 

32
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,060
“耐心总是那么糟糕吗？”
"Is patiences always such a bad thing?", 

33
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,450
慢有时意味着更快，
that's slow sometimes mean faster

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,912
如果你所做的事情是针对根源系统的，
if what you're doing is going to the root system 

35
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,500
而不是仅仅用症状解来掩盖问题
rather than just putting wallpaper over a problem

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,830
并假装已经问题已修复好了。
and pretending that it's fixed. 

38
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,820
我认为在组织生活和
I think there's a lot in organizational life 

39
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,035
我们的社会生活中，有很多东西
and a lot in our societal life that requires

40
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:09,061
需要我们有持久的耐心去见证，
that steady patience witnessing that

42
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:13,580
这可以帮助在我们一些最棘手的问题上
can help create long-lasting and deep-rooted change 

43
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,436
创造持久和根深蒂固的变化，
around some of our most intractable issues, 

44
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:21,708
而只是进行投票并尽快完成
whereas just taking a vote and getting it over with 

45
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:25,213
以缓解紧张局势，
as quickly as possible to relieve the tension,

47
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:31,985
缓解未触及的事情或规定答案
really leaves things untouched or prescribing the answer 

48
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,890
并为人们提供解决问题的技术
and giving people the technique that will solve the problem 

50
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,600
实际上这种做法并未触及更深层次的事情。
really leaves the deeper things untouched.
