1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,139
And so Woolman traveled the East Coast for almost 20 years 

2
00:00:05,139 --> 00:00:11,139
sharing what he felt had been laid upon him 

3
00:00:11,139 --> 00:00:13,550
by the Lord about the evils of slavery. 

4
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,383
He was famous for appearing in 

5
00:00:16,383 --> 00:00:23,423
for wearing undyed clothing, plain white clothing, 

6
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:27,430
because the dyned was a product of slave labor.

8
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:33,133
And he was famous for showing up at a farmhouse at night 

9
00:00:33,133 --> 00:00:35,840
and if he learned that the meal had been prepared by 

10
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:37,970
or if it was being served by a slave, 

11
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:40,610
he would fast while he stayed a table, 

12
00:00:40,610 --> 00:00:44,010
so he was utterly consistent with his message

13
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:45,720
in both his words and in his actions. 

14
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:50,700
And after 20 years of this witnessing, 

15
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,590
this mirroring back to this holding up 

16
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,923
of a mirror where people could, 

17
00:00:56,923 --> 00:00:59,050
while they were eating the meal  

18
00:00:59,050 --> 00:00:59,640
that a slave had prepared or served.

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:04,400
Woolman was speaking of fundamental Quaker beliefs

20
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,330
and not haranguing that just witnessing testify.

22
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,940
After 20 years of this, 

23
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:14,280
Quakers reached consensus on freeing their slaves.

24
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,650
Now the important point in this story is 

25
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:19,409
not only the way he held up a mirror to

26
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:23,470
people's lives patiently over a long period of time, 

27
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:27,570
but that Quakers were the first religious community 

28
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:29,759
in the United States to free their slaves.

29
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,500
And they did so 80 years before the Civil War was fought. 

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:39,470
It's a story that allows me to ask the question, 

32
00:01:39,470 --> 00:01:44,060
"Is patients always such a bad thing?", 

33
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:47,450
that's slow sometimes mean faster

34
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:51,912
if what you're doing is going to the root system 

35
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:55,500
rather than just putting wallpaper over a problem

37
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,830
and pretending that it's fixed. 

38
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,820
I think there's a lot in organizational life 

39
00:02:01,820 --> 00:02:05,035
and a lot in our societal life that requires

40
00:02:05,035 --> 00:02:09,061
that steady patient witnessing that

42
00:02:09,061 --> 00:02:13,580
can help create long-lasting and deep-rooted change 

43
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:16,436
around some of our most intractable issues, 

44
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:21,708
whereas just taking a vote and getting it over with 

45
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:26,713
as quickly as possible to relieve the tension really leaves, 

47
00:02:26,713 --> 00:02:31,985
leaves things untouched or prescribing the answer 

48
00:02:31,985 --> 00:02:36,890
and giving people the technique that will solve the problem 

50
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,600
really leaves the deeper things untouched.
