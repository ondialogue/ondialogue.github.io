1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:02,866
Very few people have an experience

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:05,766
like Saul on the road to Damascus where we just get

3
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:07,866
blown over by the Holy Spirit

4
00:00:07,866 --> 00:00:09,533
and suddenly everything's changed.

5
00:00:09,533 --> 00:00:12,713
So we have to listen for nudges 

6
00:00:12,713 --> 00:00:15,799
and leadings and little quiet steps.

7
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:20,100
So my experience is of feeling small nudges that

9
00:00:20,100 --> 00:00:25,699
feel like they are from God and that I need to pay attention to,

11
00:00:25,966 --> 00:00:29,799
and if I stop and slow down and have others sit with me

12
00:00:29,966 --> 00:00:32,799
to reflect on those nudges,

13
00:00:32,966 --> 00:00:35,499
I can sense whether they're really something

14
00:00:36,500 --> 00:00:38,766
pushing me in a direction I need to go

15
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:41,266
or is it just a momentary fancy?

16
00:00:46,066 --> 00:00:49,299
Clearness Committees are formed when

17
00:00:49,733 --> 00:00:57,799
a individual, a couple, a group comes to a Quaker body and say,

19
00:00:58,333 --> 00:01:02,463
We are wrestling with this issue

21
00:01:02,463 --> 00:01:07,966
and we want to discern the way forward."

22
00:01:08,200 --> 00:01:11,340
It's important to know how to help 

23
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:13,366
people to do their discernment

24
00:01:13,866 --> 00:01:16,310
because it's not something that 

25
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:20,166
we learn automatically in our society.

26
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,066
It's not always something we learn at home.

27
00:01:23,133 --> 00:01:25,919
So it's a skill that can be learned,

28
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,366
but we have to practice.

29
00:01:28,866 --> 00:01:30,357
The prep work for the committee is 

30
00:01:30,357 --> 00:01:32,166
to hold the person in the light

31
00:01:32,166 --> 00:01:34,866
and be prepared for the questions that may come up

32
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,366
and read the writing in advance to be prepared for

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,533
holding this person in the committee meeting.

34
00:01:41,533 --> 00:01:42,966
Before the meeting,

35
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:48,300
I find a grounded place and

36
00:01:48,933 --> 00:01:53,533
I would pray for that person,

38
00:01:53,966 --> 00:02:04,866
 or, to use the Quaker saying "hold them in the Light."

42
00:02:04,866 --> 00:02:13,200
And, for me, holding people in the light,

44
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:26,066
I visually try to see them surrounded by a halo of light.

46
00:02:27,733 --> 00:02:32,199
The first thing I would say is just to let the person talk.

48
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,400
And I find that often,

49
00:02:38,933 --> 00:02:41,700
we don't have a space to be able to talk

52
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,666
about the things that really matter to us,

53
00:02:43,766 --> 00:02:46,099
and so just holding a space where somebody actually

54
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:49,073
just gets to tell you the whole story 

55
00:02:49,073 --> 00:02:53,166
and why it's important to them, is a gift.

57
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:54,976
So when you serve on a Clearness Committee, 

58
00:02:54,976 --> 00:03:04,133
the first piece of that is listening deeply to the person

60
00:03:04,366 --> 00:03:07,266
who's requested a Clearness Committee.

61
00:03:07,266 --> 00:03:09,399
So the first piece is to listen deeply

62
00:03:09,733 --> 00:03:11,696
and not just to listen deeply 

63
00:03:11,696 --> 00:03:15,199
to that individual and to their story

64
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,366
but also to listen deeply

65
00:03:17,366 --> 00:03:21,566
for the still small voice that of God in that person,

67
00:03:22,266 --> 00:03:24,499
and how this Spirit might be moving.

68
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:26,266
We're all listening to the same source,

69
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,966
the same God is speaking to all of us.

70
00:03:30,533 --> 00:03:33,533
So if I'm saying that, like,

71
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,900
there's a leading that is coming from God

72
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,800
that is telling me to do something,

73
00:03:38,866 --> 00:03:41,899
I have no doubt at all that

74
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,600
another friend would be able to, like,

75
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:49,766
with enough listening, totally hear that.

77
00:03:52,166 --> 00:03:55,099
Asking each other queries is powerful

78
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:59,299
because it stops us from giving advice.

79
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,400
It's an opportunity for us to ask open and honest questions

81
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,119
of a person who has the wisdom 

83
00:04:07,119 --> 00:04:10,566
within themselves to find an answer.

84
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:13,266
And so, instead of saying,

85
00:04:13,266 --> 00:04:15,299
"Oh, a similar thing happened to me",

86
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,966
or "I know what you should do in this situation",

87
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:22,100
we sit and listen to what the person is asking

88
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,933
and then we ask questions about

89
00:04:25,533 --> 00:04:30,133
things that they already know but haven't discerned yet.

90
00:04:31,333 --> 00:04:35,666
Questions make the space for the Spirit

92
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:38,133
to speak and to be listened to,

93
00:04:40,366 --> 00:04:45,283
rather than, like, kind of laying the options on the table, saying 

95
00:04:45,283 --> 00:04:47,500
"Select, choose wisely,

96
00:04:47,566 --> 00:04:49,133
here's which one I would choose".

97
00:04:50,066 --> 00:04:51,066
It's really,

98
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:56,900
that's not what Quaker discernment is supposed to ideally be,

100
00:04:57,533 --> 00:05:02,435
and like, the questions open the door,

102
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:05,399
I think for just really exciting possibilities.

104
00:05:05,933 --> 00:05:08,666
I always consider them as a gift.

105
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,533
It's a gift of another experience

106
00:05:11,766 --> 00:05:14,699
and so you look at whatever you're thinking about

107
00:05:15,333 --> 00:05:16,599
from that point of view.

108
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,100
It might never have occurred to us or to me,

109
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,900
to look at it in that way,

110
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,933
but hearing someone else

111
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:29,999
ask a question allows us to broaden how we look,

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,066
how we consider what it is we're doing.

114
00:05:33,700 --> 00:05:35,666
So you could say something like,

115
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,899
"When you imagine yourself in 5 years,

117
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,066
and you've taken that job that you're discerning around,

118
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:51,600
how does that person that you are in 5 years feel?".

120
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:58,333
Or you could say something open-ended like:

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,333
"If the spirit closed that door,

123
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,700
and you weren't offered that job,

124
00:06:06,366 --> 00:06:08,199
how would you feel about that?".

125
00:06:08,566 --> 00:06:11,066
So those kinds of open-ended questions

126
00:06:11,066 --> 00:06:16,533
that helps the individual imagine the various possibilities.

128
00:06:18,766 --> 00:06:24,951
Even though I might have my own desires for them,

129
00:06:24,951 --> 00:06:29,656
I try to acknowledge I have them,

131
00:06:29,656 --> 00:06:36,666
but I just try to keep them from influenceing them and

132
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,066
ask them open-ended questions to really

133
00:06:43,666 --> 00:06:52,199
find out more about them and 

136
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:58,533
what they are asking for clearness for. 

137
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:03,633
And then,  worshiping with them 

138
00:07:03,633 --> 00:07:07,299
and praying with them for guidance.
