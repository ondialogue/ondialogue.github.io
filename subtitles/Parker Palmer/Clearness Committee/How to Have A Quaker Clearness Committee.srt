1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:02,166
Early on my time with quakers

2
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:04,733
I learned about this thing called a Clearness Committee.

4
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:08,133
And it was basically the way it was described to me,

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,766
it's like you've got something you need to figure out,

6
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:12,666
you have a problem you need to solve

7
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,399
or question you need to answer.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
You don't necessarily need advice.

9
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,533
You probably know what you need to do,

10
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,486
but you need to clear through all the things that 

11
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:24,200
are interrupting your ability to access what,

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,666
in your heart of hearts know you need to do.

13
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:29,099
so you can then have a clearness committee.

14
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:37,766
I have a personal prayer.

15
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:41,666
I am the clay, mold me.

16
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,599
I am the vessel, fill me.

18
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:49,499
I am the instrument, use me.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,766
But in trying to decide how best to be used,

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,600
I need the prayer and support and listening of others.

21
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:05,666
A Clearness committee is

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,066
a small group of friends that gather and

24
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,850
basically ask you tough questions about 

25
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,566
what your leading is, what your concern is,

26
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:18,133
what's happening inside you, what do you feel.

27
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:21,066
Well, people we regularly have,

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,566
what's called a clearness committee for marriage.

29
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,519
We have Clearance Committees about 

30
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:34,800
whether people are actually called to do a ministry 

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,533
that they're thinking about.

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,566
We have clearness for membership.

33
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:48,133
Are you ready to join the Religious Society of Friends?

35
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,300
A Clearness Committee, I think, in Quaker terms,

36
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:53,699
very much involves humility.

37
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,799
You are submitting yourself,

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,650
generally voluntarily, to an entity that is 

39
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,699
a part of your Meeting, your congregation.

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,000
A lot of people will convene a Clearance Committee

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,699
if they are getting married,

44
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:11,606
or if they're choosing what college to go to, 

45
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:15,817
or choosing which direction to go in their career,

46
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:16,699
or that sort of thing.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,066
So that's where we get the name Clearness Committee.

48
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:23,599
It's about clearness, becoming clear about a decision.

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,066
When we call this group together,

50
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:32,299
we're looking for very specific kinds of people.

51
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,933
We're looking for people who are good at listening

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,766
and who don't have a tendency to give advice.

53
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:42,666
These should be people that are important in your life

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,666
and in the life of your community.

55
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,706
But not so close to you that 

56
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,539
they're going to be influenced by

57
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,933
 your decision one way or the other.

58
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,766
They're not there to provide answers.

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,733
They are there to try and help you see clearly

60
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,399
what the situation is, what's happening,

61
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,966
and what you should do about it.

62
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,466
It's a gift of your spiritual community,

63
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:06,799
saying, "You don't have to struggle alone.

64
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:11,799
Here are your companions that can work with you

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,266
and go on this part of your journey with you",

67
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:17,566
which is, to me, phenomenal in this day and age.

68
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:24,516
That we could be so blessed that our community says,

69
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:25,966
"You don't have to do this alone.

70
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:26,933
We will help."

71
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:32,899
The prep work for a Clearness Committee is that

72
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,066
the clerk will find a place in time

73
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,533
and put together the committee,

74
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,453
and then the person who is the focus person of 

75
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:44,166
the committee will write a page or two in advance.

77
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,899
And so you start off by

78
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:49,199
actually describing the situation.

79
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:53,116
Like, really sitting down, writing it out so that 

80
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,199
everybody has access to it and you can say, 

81
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,933
"Okay, this is what's going on,

82
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,266
and this is why it's confusing to me.

83
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:03,266
These are what I perceive 

84
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:06,066
my options to be in this situation.

85
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,666
What am I missing?".

87
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:16,199
The steps involved in the actual Clearness Committee

88
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,133
are to come together and for the person who is

89
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,066
asking for the Clearness Committee

90
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:24,766
to state what it is that they want clarity on.

91
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:28,299
So they state their problem or decision point.

92
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,933
Even though it's been passed out beforehand,

93
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,683
I say in my own words, 

94
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:37,533
"This is the situation as I understand it".

95
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,133
Then the committee should ask clarifying questions

96
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:42,133
that are really just about facts.

97
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,366
Like, "Did you mean you're moving to  

98
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:47,733
Georgia in the U.S or Georgia in Asia?".

99
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:49,333
That kind of thing.

100
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,666
And then after this time of questioning,

101
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,799
we sit and we wait.

102
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,133
And I've been in Clearness Committees where

103
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,733
sitting and waiting lasted for 20 minutes,

104
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:05,499
and I've been in Clearness Committees where

105
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,666
sitting and waiting lasted for 3 hours.

106
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,566
So usually people will just listen

107
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,199
and hold this space together,

108
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:16,366
and ask the Spirit to bring to them clarity.

109
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,533
The committee starts listening together

111
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:22,733
and asking deeper spiritual questions.

112
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,866
Do you feel that God is calling you to do this?

113
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,966
How do you see your life evolving

114
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:29,666
if you follow this path?

115
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,417
How do you see your life evolving 

116
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,999
if you turn away from this opportunity?

117
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,599
So the questions that a Clearness Committee

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,066
asks are all going to be questions that are open ended.

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,333
And that lead to greater self-reflection,

121
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:54,966
and to a deeper prayer and to a more imaginative

124
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,533
engagement with the problem or question.

126
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:00,366
At that point,

127
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:03,467
the committee's role is to step back and listen and 

128
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:07,799
let the focus person for the clearness process really

130
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,566
respond to those questions at a deep

131
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,066
heart mind and spirit level.

132
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,733
So out of that time, a lot of times people will

133
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,199
share things that they noticed.

134
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,499
Maybe they'll share,

135
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,083
"I noticed your eyes really light up 

136
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,533
when you talked about this idea",

137
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,983
or "I noticed a change in your body posture 

138
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,166
when you're talking about this decision".

140
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,026
But my experience in this is that 

141
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:32,699
when you've got this group of people

142
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,600
gathered to listen around this issue,

143
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,383
each person is going to hear 

144
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:43,199
a little piece of God's voice, of away forward.

146
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,866
A lot of times, the person themselves will

148
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:48,666
start feeling that clarity in themselves and

149
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,699
will be able to name it to some degree

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
and to be able to say, 

151
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,266
"Yes, when you shared that, 

151
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:54,966
I really felt like that rang true",

152
00:06:54,966 --> 00:07:00,099
or "That felt right within my body or my spirit".

153
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,433
I've come into a Clearness Committee 

154
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:06,366
with a preconceived notion of what's going to happen,

156
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,733
and it gets blown out of the water every single time.

157
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,800
It's kind of hilarious that way.

159
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,966
I've been on Clearness Committees where the group

160
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,933
found that people weren't clear to get married,

162
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,566
for instance, or that membership  

163
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:27,533
might need to take a little more time,

164
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,500
or that there might need to be 2 or 3 or 4 meetings

165
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,733
faced that over a number of months before

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,566
we get at the clearness part of things.

167
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:39,599
I think that's helpful in a couple of ways.

169
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,166
It's helpful in the "yes", like of,

170
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,566
"Ah, yes, like this was a leading, so okay self-doubt

171
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,933
like, take that, there's a committee of other

172
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,166
friends who have listened and heard!".

173
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,099
It's also like,

174
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,133
I can rejoice in the "no".

175
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:00,150
Like, when a Clearance Ccommittee ends in a "wait",

176
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,966
or like, "That wasn't what I thought it was".

178
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,666
Then that's coming from God

179
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,333
and I can feel so much more comfortable

180
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,533
in that "no" or in that "wait"

181
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,866
than just like, "Well I really said no, or wait,

183
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:16,666
but it was just like my own self-doubt".

184
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,533
That's gone.

185
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,999
That's kinda out of the picture

186
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,466
at the end of a Clearness Committee.

187
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,599
Sometimes you don't come to clarity,

188
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,139
so that's kind of a bummer when that happens.

189
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,899
But it definitely is not uncommon,

190
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,753
so if that happens to you, don't worry,

191
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:33,366
you're not a failure at Quakerism.

192
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,533
You can try again or

193
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,520
you can allow the wisdom that did emerge 

194
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,599
out of that community to inform your decision.

196
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,266
In this space of faithful waiting and listening,

199
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,733
and frankly listening with love 

200
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,699
for the person who has the question,

201
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:59,499
means that when we bring that love together

202
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:06,366
in the different ways each individual holds that,

204
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:15,899
even if no clarity comes from it,

206
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,900
there is a sense of being held in love by our community

207
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,400
that can make the lack of clarity 

208
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,966
not as scary as it used to be.
