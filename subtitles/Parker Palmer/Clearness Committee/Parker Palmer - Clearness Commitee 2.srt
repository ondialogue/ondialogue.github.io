1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,870
But to cut to the chase, the Clearness Committee is 

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,279
basically an inquiry model of being in the world. 

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,530
And I like to say 

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,230
especially that in academic setting that

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,580
what a Clearness Committee does with an individual 

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,970
by way of inquiring honestly 

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,970
and openly into who that individual is 

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,359
and what that individuals inner teachers has to say. 

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,210
It's the same posture that 

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,180
a scholar adopts, a great scholar adopts

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,579
 toward whatever it is that he or she is studying. 

12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,972
If you're a physicist you're not in the world 

13
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,770
to locate a subatomic particle and then tell it 

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,279
what it's supposed to be doing or tell it what its nature is. 

16
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,379
Great physicists actually

17
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,290
listen to the thing they're trying to understand. 

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,640
And they have such a passion

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,660
about understanding that thing on its own terms 

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,065
without imposing false categories on it. 

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,070
That they're very good listeners, 

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,140
great scholars are always very good listeners, 

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,110
because they have such reverence and respect 

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,270
for whatever they are studying that 

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,511
they want to hear  it into speech, 

27
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:21,920
they wanted to speak to them in its own voice. 

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,110
And the  puzzlement for me in universities

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,750
frankly has been why we know how to 

30
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,790
extend that respect to subatomic

31
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,394
particles or bodies of literature or periods of history, 

32
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:38,065
but we don't know how to respect to each other. 

33
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,990
So the Clearness Committee is an opportunity

35
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,404
to do it for each other which seems right 

36
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:49,390
and proper to me and fruitful life giving. 

37
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,614
In organizational terms, I think 

38
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,610
the Clearness Committee is like the 

39
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,789
good leader who walks around basically saying, 

40
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,260
"What's happening here? 

41
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,460
And how are you experiencing what's happening?",

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,199
and listen very carefully in a way that 

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,270
helps people hold a mirror up to themselves

44
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,110
and engage in that most remarkable 

45
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,780
human activity called self-correction.

46
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,150
Just as you look at yourself in the mirror 

47
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,390
to see that you are missing the mark.

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,090
Not because someone tells you that you're missing the mark, 

50
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,100
but because you already know what the mark is. 

51
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,100
And the mirror helps you see there you're off target.

53
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,241
There's a way I think of leading in an organization 

54
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:50,040
or of helping an organization understand its own life.

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,910
That is much more about mirroring than it is  

57
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,644
about advising, fixing, saving and setting everybody straight.

59
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:03,900
And mirroring is powerful, because when 

60
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,600
people see themselvess in the mirror and 

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,770
engage in that activity called 

62
00:03:09,770 --> 00:03:14,600
self-correction or self-analysis or self-understanding, 

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,270
the results are much more likely to be permanent and deep 

64
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,370
than they are when some outsider comes along and says, 

66
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,019
"Oh, you got this all wrong, 

67
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,389
better you should do it this way!",

68
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,910
which people may do for a week or two and then 

69
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,670
they'll revert to whatever it is they're more comfortable with.
