1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,030
让我给你讲讲
Well, let me start by giving just  

2
00:00:02,030 --> 00:00:03,840
澄心委员会的贵格会历史。
a Quaker history of the Clearness Committee.

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:09,389
澄心委员会在350年前
The Clearness Committee has emerged within

4
00:00:09,389 --> 00:00:12,480
贵格会创建之初就出现了，
the beginnings of Quakerism 350 years ago,

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,620
其缘由很简单，
for a very simple reason, 

6
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:19,890
贵格会是基督教教会的一种形式，
Quakers  were a form of the Christian Church that

7
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,030
没有牧师领导。
had no pastoral leadership. 

8
00:00:22,030 --> 00:00:23,730
他们没有受命的神职人员。
They didn't have ordained clergy. 

9
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:27,630
他们没有一个指定的人
They didn't have a designated person 

10
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:31,331
去处理问题和难题，
to go to with problems issues questions, 

11
00:00:31,331 --> 00:00:36,660
因此他们需要创造公共结构，
so they needed  to invent communal structures that

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:39,560
使社区能够围绕着这些问题进行对话和处理，
enabled the community to come together around things 

13
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,142
而在其它教堂中人们通常把
that in other churches people would take 

14
00:00:42,142 --> 00:00:46,720
这些问题带到牧师或神父那里去寻求帮助。
into the pastor's office or into the priests office. 

16
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:48,219
当然，其中要处理的一件事是，
One of those thing of course is  

17
00:00:48,219 --> 00:00:51,480
人们生活中挣扎的特定议题。
that people struggle with certain issues in life.

18
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,889
他们可能有职业上的挣扎，
they may have a vocational struggle  

19
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:56,610
或者可能有关系上的挣扎，
or they may have a relationship struggle 

20
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,059
或者可能有围绕问题意义上的挣扎。
or they may have a struggle around questions of meaning. 

21
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:05,365
所以澄心委员会的出现
And so the Clearness Committee emerged as a way  

22
00:01:05,365 --> 00:01:09,803
是为了让该宗教团体的五六名成员
for five or six members from that religious community 

24
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:13,106
与有问题的人坐在一起，
to sit with a person who had a problem

25
00:01:13,106 --> 00:01:18,259
并且帮助那个人唤起
and to help that person evoke 

26
00:01:18,259 --> 00:01:22,550
与自己内在导师的联结。
the resources of his or her inner teacher. 

27
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,750
这其实是以贵格会的两个关键信仰为前提。
It's really premise two key Quaker beliefs. 

28
00:01:26,750 --> 00:01:29,710
其一，我们每个人都有一个
One is we all have an inner teacher that 

29
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,830
比世界上任何人都知道我们需要什么的内在导师。
knows what we need than anybody else in the world. 

31
00:01:32,830 --> 00:01:35,570
其二，为了接触到那个
And the other is that in order to get access to 

32
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,540
内在导师，我们需要社区的帮助。
that inner teacher we need to be in community. 

33
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:44,170
一个可以帮助我们整理和筛选
A community that can help us sort and sift 

35
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:48,410
我们觉得我们听到的是什么声音的社区。
what voice it is we think we're hearing. 

36
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:51,482
因为贵格会成员像其他人一样
Because Quakers know as well as anybody else 

37
00:01:51,482 --> 00:01:54,600
知道我们内在有不同的声音。
that we have a variety of voices within us. 

38
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,680
我们有恐惧的声音，
There's a voice of fear,

39
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,469
有小我的声音，等等。
there's a voice of egos, etc. 

40
00:01:58,469 --> 00:02:00,520
而且我们还有内在导师的声音。
And there's a voice of the inner teacher. 

41
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,610
所以他们知道你
So they understood that you  

42
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:04,124
不能只是独自坐在房间中，
couldn't just sit alone in your room 

43
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:06,000
并且说，“哦，有一个内在导师，
and say, "Oh, there's an inner teacher, 

44
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,600
我最好起身并跟随”，
I better get up and follow, 

45
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,550
而是告诉我们，所有人都需要社区
but that we all need community 

46
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:11,530
来帮助我们进行分类和筛选内在之声。
to do that sorting and sifting. 

47
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,069
但是我们所需的社区
But the kind of community 

48
00:02:15,069 --> 00:02:17,260
不是那种会告诉你
that was needed was not a community that 

49
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:19,940
答案是什么的社区，
would tell you what your answer was,  

50
00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:23,290
而是这样一个社区，
it was rather a community that in the great

51
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,840
用女权主义神学家
words of a feminist theologian named

52
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,150
内尔·莫顿的话来说，帮助你聆听、
Nell Morton would help hear you into speech, 

53
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,190
越来越深地倾听，
deeper and deeper speech, 

54
00:02:32,190 --> 00:02:34,460
越来越真实地聆听的社区。
more and more truthful speech. 

55
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:37,030
由此产生的澄心委员会，
And so the  Clearness Committee that resulted from

56
00:02:37,030 --> 00:02:39,190
由五六个人组成，
that consists of five or six people who

57
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:41,689
他们与你坐在一起几个小时，
sit with you for several hours  

58
00:02:41,689 --> 00:02:44,769
在此期间，他们基本上什么都不做，
and during that process of time, 

59
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:48,170
除了问你一些诚实的开放的问题。
basically do nothing but ask you honest open questions. 

60
00:02:49,870 --> 00:02:54,300
这里有一些隐含的东西，
There's a lot sort of hidden and what I just said 

61
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,476
我刚才说得的话听起来很简单，
even though it sounds quite simple, 

62
00:02:56,476 --> 00:02:57,730
因为事实证明，
because it turns out 

63
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:02,170
向你提出诚实而开放的问题是
that asking you honest open questions is

64
00:03:02,170 --> 00:03:06,060
一项非常艰巨的任务。
a very demanding assignment. 

65
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,955
我们非常擅长于问一些
We are so gifted at asking questions 

66
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,260
既不诚实又不开放的问题，
that aren't honest and open, 

67
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:15,600
而这些问题实际上是些建议或变相的演讲。
but that are really advices or speeches in disguise. 

68
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:20,040
如果我问，“你是否想过要去看治疗师”，
So if I ask have you thought about seeing a therapist, 

69
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,470
这就不是一个诚实而开放的问题。
that's not an honest open question. 

70
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:23,570
我想说的其实是，
I'm really trying to say,  

71
00:03:23,570 --> 00:03:25,305
我认为“你应该去看治疗师”，
I think you ought to see a therapist  

72
00:03:25,305 --> 00:03:28,580
而这是我偷偷提出建议的方式。
and here's my way of sneaking that advice in.

73
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:31,780
所以这个方法有很多要求
So there's a lot in here that is 

74
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:33,730
很高的部分，需要我们进行练习。
demanding that requires practice.
