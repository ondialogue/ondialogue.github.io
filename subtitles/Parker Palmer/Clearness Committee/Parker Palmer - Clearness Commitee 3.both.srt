00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
{\an5}<font size="60px">澄心委员会（三）</font>

2
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,150
以这种方式在一个组织中工作需要很大的耐心。
It takes a lot of patience to be in an organization this way. 

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:10,010
因为我们内心确实有要
Because we do have  in us is impulse 

4
00:00:10,010 --> 00:00:14,820
控制过程并“得到结果”的冲动。
to control processes and quotes 'get results'. 

5
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,420
有很多咨询都会进入修正模式,
And the  fixing mode that a lot of consultants get into, 

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,370
从表面上看，它在控制过程和
looks on the surface like it's doing a better job 

7
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:26,730
获得结果方面做得更好。
of controlling processes and getting results. 

8
00:00:27,730 --> 00:00:31,030
我的感觉是，这往往是
My sense is though that is often an illusion

10
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,470
在短时间内被制造出来的一种幻觉，
that gets manufactured for a short period of time 

11
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:39,510
之后一切又恢复原状。
and then things revert back to the status quo. 

12
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,210
无论在组织里还是在这个世界上,
It takes more time in patients, 

13
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:46,950
以一种问询的方式帮助
to be in that organization or in the world, 

14
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:49,920
人们在镜子中看到自己，
in an inquiry mode which helps people

16
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,590
需要有更多的耐心。
see themselves in the mirror. 

17
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:57,400
但是一旦人们看清了自己,
But once they've seen themselves, 

18
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:02,260
这种转变更有可能
the transformation is much more likely to 

19
00:01:02,260 --> 00:01:10,039
站稳脚跟，持续下去，走得更远。 
have legs to stand, to last, to make the distance. 

20
00:01:10,039 --> 00:01:14,480
在贵格会传统中，有一个伟大的故事，
There's actually a great story out of Quaker tradition 

21
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,340
我很乐意告诉大家。
that I'd love to tell about this. 

23
00:01:16,340 --> 00:01:19,180
这个故事是历史事实，
Because it's historical fact and 

24
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:24,119
我认为它见证了我想说的这一点。
I think it witnesses to the point I'm trying to make. 

25
00:01:26,619 --> 00:01:30,123
在美国内战爆发前一百年,
A hundred years before the Civil War was fought, 

26
00:01:30,123 --> 00:01:33,330
东海岸有贵格会教徒，
there were Quakers on the East Coast 

27
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:36,170
像其他人一样他们拥有奴隶,
who like everybody else owned slaves, 

28
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:41,101
这些人是农民，用奴隶来经营农场，
they were farmers and you ran a farm with slaves 

29
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,270
而这就是当时的美国经济。
that was the American economy. 

30
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:47,279
在贵格会教友团体中,
And there was among within that Quaker community, 

31
00:01:47,279 --> 00:01:48,910
有一个叫约翰·伍尔曼的人,
a man named John Woolman, 

32
00:01:48,910 --> 00:01:54,949
正如他所说的，上帝告示他，
who had it as he said laid upon him by the Lord 

33
00:01:54,949 --> 00:01:58,185
奴隶制是邪恶的，是道德上的错误。
that slavery was evil and moral wrong. 

34
00:01:58,185 --> 00:02:04,259
上帝召唤贵格会教徒来解放他们的奴隶。
And the Quakers, that God was calling Quakers to free their slaves. 

36
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:10,964
伍尔曼把这个告示带到了当地会众的集会上。
He took this to his local meeting, congregation. 

38
00:02:12,064 --> 00:02:16,770
会众在公开对话中与伍尔曼进行理论。
And they wrestled with it in open dialogue. 

39
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:22,190
但他们无法达成共识，
And could not come to consensus 

40
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,079
对贵格会教徒而言必须要做的是：
which is what Quakers have to do, 

41
00:02:24,079 --> 00:02:25,220
他们不对结果投票,
they don't take a vote,  

42
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:27,614
因为他们认为投票是暴力的，
because they think voting is violent

43
00:02:27,614 --> 00:02:31,387
如果51%的人能告诉49%的人该何去何从,
 if 51% can tell 49% where to get off,

44
00:02:31,387 --> 00:02:33,660
这就是一种暴力行为。
that's an act of violence.  

45
00:02:33,660 --> 00:02:37,560
他们努力促成共识，
And so they labored with it trying to reach consensus 

46
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:39,379
但却无法达成。
but couldn't reach consensus. 

47
00:02:39,379 --> 00:02:41,770
不过他们对约翰 · 伍尔曼说,
But they said to John Woolman,  

48
00:02:41,770 --> 00:02:45,999
“虽然我们自己还未开启明灯，
"While we don't yet have this light for ourselves,

49
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:48,259
但我们毫无疑问认为
we don't have any doubt 

50
00:02:48,259 --> 00:02:50,900
你对一些事情看得非常清楚,
that you're  seeing something very clearly, 

51
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:52,773
只是我们还未看到。
we just can't see it yet. 

52
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:55,269
因此，当你在东海岸
And so we will support  your family  

53
00:02:55,269 --> 00:02:59,150
贵格会朋友中东奔西走期间，
while you travel among Quaker Friends 

54
00:02:59,150 --> 00:03:03,859
传递信息、分享启示，
up and down the East Coast, delivering your message 

55
00:03:03,859 --> 00:03:07,159
只为废除奴隶制这件事情可以发生，
sharing your revelation for as long as

56
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:09,590
我们会照顾好你的家庭的。
it takes for some kind of outcome to happen.
