1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:09,010
Discernment is really the heart and the core
of everything we do as Friends.

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:13,320
It's the core of our practice in worship,
it's the core of our practice in worship

3
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:22,080
for business, it's the center of how we make
decisions in our lives, to marry, for our

4
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:31,660
employment, for our work in the world, for
our ministry.

5
00:00:31,660 --> 00:00:51,430
The process of discernment and being called,
or having a leading or the deepest knowing.

6
00:00:51,430 --> 00:01:00,510
All of those feel like incredibly connected, if
not the exact same thing.

7
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:04,980
For me, discernment is the core technology
of Quakerism.

8
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:17,330
It is the thing that we learn to do and that
our faith supports.

9
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:32,230
And that is to thresh through the complexity
of life and find the kernel, find the root,

10
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:41,110
find the way. The way for me today, 
at this moment.

11
00:01:41,110 --> 00:01:44,240
Some people may call it 
seeking the will of God.

12
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,299
Others may call it consulting 
their deep inner wisdom.

13
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:55,750
I think a lot of people do discernment relatively
spontaneously when they have a sticky issue

14
00:01:55,750 --> 00:01:59,790
to deal with, and they stop, they let it rest
a while.

15
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,240
They let an answer rise up in them.

16
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:13,310
To tell the difference between the still
small voice that's guiding me well and the

17
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:19,870
many other voices, the many other fine, human
voices that are within me.

18
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:28,550
So, discernment is listening for God's will
for us to move us more fully into God's understanding

19
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:37,290
of the kingdom of heaven, of right order between
all creation, humans and plants and animals

20
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:43,060
and ideas, I would even say.

21
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:50,910
Of course, part of Quaker discernment is the
rational, reasonable assessment of the pros

22
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,560
and cons of the decision at hand.

23
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:04,880
Discernment takes it a step farther than that
and invites us to go to a deep place, a centered

24
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:18,380
place, and to see how. How where our rational
minds have led us, sits in us.

25
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:25,019
Discernment is accessing that place where
God is at work in us, and it's well beyond

26
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:32,000
rational, thoughtful, weighing of the situation.

27
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:43,480
It's not without an information gathering
phase where we have to understand the parameters

28
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:54,240
clearly, but then, after that, it comes down
to accessing that same place that vocal ministry

29
00:03:54,240 --> 00:04:00,991
comes from, that place of deep faithfulness
where we don't care whether it's this or that.

30
00:04:00,991 --> 00:04:09,221
We have no investment in which side of that
question we fall on, and: "God, what do you

31
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:10,790
want me to do here?"

32
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:18,009
And so then we listen with the reason, we
listen with emotion, we listen with inspiration,

33
00:04:18,009 --> 00:04:23,839
and, kind of, more than a touch of hope.

34
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:28,339
And I'll say, experientially, I know that
it functions.

35
00:04:28,339 --> 00:04:29,370
It works.

36
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:35,389
That when we trust one another, when we are
able to be vulnerable with one another, when

37
00:04:35,389 --> 00:04:39,699
we allow ourselves to think that it might
actually be the case that God is an actual

38
00:04:39,699 --> 00:04:44,360
thing that we might actually be able to hear
and might live into actually better lives,

39
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,360
well, and behold something happens in
that space.

40
00:04:48,360 --> 00:05:07,509
So, discernment, for me, is definitely a listening,
but it also is this process 

41
00:05:07,509 --> 00:05:13,000
of allowing and letting go.
