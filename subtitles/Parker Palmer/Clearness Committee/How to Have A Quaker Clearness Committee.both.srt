1
00:00:00,133 --> 00:00:02,166
在与贵格会成员相处的早期，
Early on my time with quakers

2
00:00:02,166 --> 00:00:04,733
我了解到一个叫澄心委员会的东西。
I learned about this thing called a Clearness Committee.

4
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:08,133
基本上我听到的是这样,
And it was basically the way it was described to me,

5
00:00:08,133 --> 00:00:10,766
就好像说，你有些事情需要处理,
it's like you've got something you need to figure out,

6
00:00:10,766 --> 00:00:12,666
有个问题需要解决
you have a problem you need to solve

7
00:00:12,666 --> 00:00:14,399
或者有需要回答的问题。
or question you need to answer.

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:16,400
你不一定需要建议。
You don't necessarily need advice.

9
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,533
你可能知道你需要做什么，
You probably know what you need to do,

10
00:00:18,533 --> 00:00:20,486
但你需要清除所有
but you need to clear through all the things that 

11
00:00:20,486 --> 00:00:24,200
干扰你的能力的东西，
are interrupting your ability to access what,

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,666
以获得你内心深处知道你需要做的事情，
in your heart of hearts know you need to do

13
00:00:26,733 --> 00:00:29,099
这样你就需要一个澄心委员会。
so you can then have a clearness committee.

14
00:00:35,866 --> 00:00:37,766
我有一个个人的祈祷。
I have a personal prayer.

15
00:00:38,966 --> 00:00:41,666
我是泥土，塑造我吧！
I am the clay, mold me.

16
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,599
我是容器，填满我吧！
I am the vessel, fill me.

18
00:00:46,566 --> 00:00:49,499
我是工具，使用我吧！
I am the instrument, use me.

19
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,766
但在试图决定如何最好地被使用时,
But in trying to decide how best to be used,

20
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:02,600
我需要别人的祈祷、支持和倾听。
I need the prayer and support and listening of others.

21
00:01:03,966 --> 00:01:05,666
澄心委员会是
A Clearness committee is

22
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:10,066
一个由教友聚在的小团体，
a small group of Friends that gather and

24
00:01:11,066 --> 00:01:12,850
基本上就是问你一些棘手的问题，
basically ask you tough questions about 

25
00:01:12,850 --> 00:01:15,566
会问，引领你的是什么，你关心的是什么,
what your leading is, what your concern is,

26
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:18,133
你内心发生了什么，你感觉到了什么。
what's happening inside you, what do you feel.

27
00:01:18,266 --> 00:01:21,066
我们会定期举行
Well, people we regularly have,

28
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:23,566
所谓的婚姻澄心委员会。
what's called a Clearness Committee for marriage.

29
00:01:26,133 --> 00:01:28,519
我们有关于人们是否真的
We have Clearance Committees about 

30
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:34,800
被召唤去做他们正在考虑去做
whether people are actually called to do a ministry 

31
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,533
某项事工的澄心委员会。
that they're thinking about.

32
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:40,566
我们有关于成员资格审核的澄心委员会。
We have clearness for membership.

33
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:48,133
我们会讨论这样的问题“你准备好加入公谊会了吗？”
Are you ready to join the Religious Society of Friends?

35
00:01:48,700 --> 00:01:51,300
我认为，用贵格会的术语来说，澄心委员会
A Clearness Committee, I think, in Quaker terms,

36
00:01:51,933 --> 00:01:53,699
在很大程度上与谦逊有关。
very much involves humility.

37
00:01:54,766 --> 00:01:56,799
你是在向一个实体，
You are submitting yourself,

38
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,650
即会议的一部分，你的会众，呈现你自己，
generally voluntarily, to an entity that is 

39
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:03,699
而这一般来说，是自愿的。
a part of your Meeting, your congregation.

41
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:06,000
很多人会召集澄心委员会，
A lot of people will convene a Clearance Committee

42
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,699
以澄清自己是否要结婚的,
if they are getting married,

44
00:02:08,733 --> 00:02:11,606
或者要选择上哪所大学,
or if they're choosing what college to go to, 

45
00:02:11,606 --> 00:02:15,817
或者选择职业生涯的方向,
or choosing which direction to go in their career,

46
00:02:15,817 --> 00:02:16,699
或者类似的东西。
or that sort of thing.

47
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,066
这就是我们为之命名澄心委员会这个名字的原因。
So that's where we get the name Clearness Committee.

48
00:02:19,066 --> 00:02:23,599
这是关于清晰的会议，对一个决定变得清晰。
It's about clearness, becoming clear about a decision.

49
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:28,066
当召集小组会议时,
When we call this group together,

50
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:32,299
我们要找的是特定类型的人。
we're looking for very specific kinds of people.

51
00:02:32,933 --> 00:02:35,933
我们要找的是善于倾听的人，
We're looking for people who are good at listening

52
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,766
并且不倾向于提供建议的人。
and who don't have a tendency to give advice.

53
00:02:39,766 --> 00:02:42,666
他们应该是你生命中以及在你的
These should be people that are important in your life

54
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:45,666
社区生活中非常重要的人。
and in the life of your community.

55
00:02:45,766 --> 00:02:47,706
但不要太接近你，
But not so close to you that 

56
00:02:47,706 --> 00:02:49,539
以至于他们会受到
they're going to be influenced by

57
00:02:49,539 --> 00:02:50,933
你所做决定的某种影响。
 your decision one way or the other.

58
00:02:50,933 --> 00:02:52,766
他们在那里不是为了提供答案。
They're not there to provide answers.

59
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:57,733
他们在那里试图帮助你看清楚
They are there to try and help you see clearly

60
00:02:58,333 --> 00:03:00,399
现在的情况什么，正在发生什么,
what the situation is, what's happening,

61
00:03:00,666 --> 00:03:01,966
以及你该怎么做。
and what you should do about it.

62
00:03:01,966 --> 00:03:04,466
这是你灵性团体的礼物，
It's a gift of your spiritual community,

63
00:03:04,566 --> 00:03:06,799
他们对你说，“你不必独自挣扎。
saying, "You don't have to struggle alone.

64
00:03:07,766 --> 00:03:11,799
我们是可以和你一起工作
Here are your companions that can work with you

66
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:14,266
并和你一起踏上这段旅程的同伴”
and go on this part of your journey with you",

67
00:03:14,266 --> 00:03:17,566
对我来说，这在当今这个时代是非凡的。
which is, to me, phenomenal in this day and age.

68
00:03:18,166 --> 00:03:24,516
我们可以如此有福气，我们的社区说,
That we could be so blessed that our community says,

69
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:25,966
“你不必独自面对。
"You don't have to do this alone.

70
00:03:26,133 --> 00:03:26,933
我们会帮助你。”
We will help."

71
00:03:29,533 --> 00:03:32,899
澄心委员会的准备工作是
The prep work for a Clearness Committee is that

72
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:35,066
书记员会及时找一个地方
the clerk will find a place in time

73
00:03:35,066 --> 00:03:36,533
召集委员会成员,
and put together the committee,

74
00:03:36,733 --> 00:03:39,453
然后委员会的焦点人物
and then the person who is the focus person of 

75
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:44,166
将提前写一两页关于其议题的说明。
the committee will write a page or two in advance.

77
00:03:44,166 --> 00:03:45,899
因此，焦点人物首先要做的是，
And so you start off by

78
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:49,199
向大家描述实际的情况。
actually describing the situation.

79
00:03:49,733 --> 00:03:53,116
比如，让自己安顿下来，写下情况，这样，
Like, really sitting down, writing it out so that 

80
00:03:53,116 --> 00:03:55,199
每个人都可以看到它，你可以说，
everybody has access to it and you can say, 

81
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,933
”好吧，事情是这样的,
"Okay, this is what's going on,

82
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:01,266
这就是为什么我很困惑。
and this is why it's confusing to me.

83
00:04:01,466 --> 00:04:03,266
这些是我认为
These are what I perceive 

84
00:04:03,266 --> 00:04:06,066
在这种情况下我的选择。
my options to be in this situation.

85
00:04:08,333 --> 00:04:10,666
我错过了什么吗?”。
What am I missing?".

87
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:16,199
澄心委员会所涉及的步骤
The steps involved in the actual Clearness Committee

88
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:20,133
事把委员召集到一起，并询问
are to come together and for the person who is

89
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:22,066
发起澄心委员会的焦点人物
asking for the Clearness Committee

90
00:04:22,066 --> 00:04:24,766
他们想明晰的到底是什么。
to state what it is that they want clarity on.

91
00:04:24,933 --> 00:04:28,299
他们在会上会陈述他们的问题或决策点。
So they state their problem or decision point.

92
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:30,933
虽然之前已发出议题说明,
Even though it's been passed out beforehand,

93
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,683
但我还会用自己的话说,
I say in my own words, 

94
00:04:33,683 --> 00:04:37,533
“这就是我所理解的情况”。
"This is the situation as I understand it".

95
00:04:37,533 --> 00:04:40,133
然后，委员会应该提出一些澄清的问题，
Then the committee should ask clarifying questions

96
00:04:40,133 --> 00:04:42,133
这些问题实际上只关心事实。
that are really just about facts.

97
00:04:42,266 --> 00:04:44,366
比如，“你是说你要搬到
Like, "Did you mean you're moving to  

98
00:04:44,366 --> 00:04:47,733
美国的格鲁吉亚还是亚洲的格鲁吉亚?”。
Georgia in the U.S or Georgia in Asia?".

99
00:04:48,466 --> 00:04:49,333
诸如此类的问题。
That kind of thing.

100
00:04:49,333 --> 00:04:52,666
然后经过这段时间的询问
And then after this time of questioning,

101
00:04:53,933 --> 00:04:55,799
我们坐下来等待。
we sit and we wait.

102
00:04:56,666 --> 00:05:00,133
我曾参加过一个澄心委员会，
And I've been in Clearness Committees where

103
00:05:00,166 --> 00:05:02,733
在那里坐着等了20分钟,
sitting and waiting lasted for 20 minutes,

104
00:05:02,866 --> 00:05:05,499
还有一次，我在一个澄心委员会，
and I've been in Clearness Committees where

105
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,666
坐着等了三个小时。
sitting and waiting lasted for 3 hours.

106
00:05:08,666 --> 00:05:10,566
通常，人们只是倾听，
So usually people will just listen

107
00:05:10,566 --> 00:05:12,199
并一起维护这个空间，
and hold this space together,

108
00:05:12,366 --> 00:05:16,366
并请求圣灵给他们带来清明。
and ask the Spirit to bring to them clarity.

109
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,533
委员会开始一起倾听焦点人物，
The committee starts listening together

111
00:05:19,533 --> 00:05:22,733
然后提出更深入的属灵问题：
and asking deeper spiritual questions.

112
00:05:22,733 --> 00:05:25,866
“你是否觉得上帝在召唤你去做这件事？”，
Do you feel that God is calling you to do this?

113
00:05:26,066 --> 00:05:27,966
“如果你走这条路，
How do you see your life evolving

114
00:05:27,966 --> 00:05:29,666
你认为你的生活会如何演变？”，
if you follow this path?

115
00:05:29,766 --> 00:05:31,417
“如果你拒绝这个机会，
How do you see your life evolving 

116
00:05:31,417 --> 00:05:33,999
你如何看待你的生活演变？”。
if you turn away from this opportunity?

117
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:35,599
澄心委员会
So the questions that a Clearness Committee

118
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:41,066
所问的所有问题都是开放式的。
asks are all going to be questions that are open ended.

120
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,333
这会导致更多的自我反省,
And that lead to greater self-reflection,

121
00:05:46,366 --> 00:05:54,966
更深入的祈祷，一级更富有想象力的
and to a deeper prayer and to a more imaginative

124
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:59,533
对问题或疑问的参与。
engagement with the problem or question.

126
00:05:59,533 --> 00:06:00,366
在这一点上，
At that point,

127
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:03,467
委员会的作用是退后一步，倾听，
the committee's role is to step back and listen and 

128
00:06:03,467 --> 00:06:07,799
并真正让焦点人物进入明晰的过程
let the focus person for the clearness process really

130
00:06:08,333 --> 00:06:10,566
在心智和属灵层面
respond to those questions at a deep

131
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,066
深入地回答这些问题。
heart mind and spirit level.

132
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,733
在这段（镜映）时间里，很多时候人们会
So out of that time, a lot of times people will

133
00:06:16,666 --> 00:06:18,199
分享他们注意到的事情。
share things that they noticed.

134
00:06:18,333 --> 00:06:19,499
也许他们会分享,
Maybe they'll share,

135
00:06:19,533 --> 00:06:21,083
“当你谈到这个想法的时候，
"I noticed your eyes really light up 

136
00:06:21,083 --> 00:06:22,533
我注意到你的眼睛亮了”，
when you talked about this idea",

137
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,983
或者，“当你谈论这个决定的时候，
or "I noticed a change in your body posture 

138
00:06:24,983 --> 00:06:27,166
我注意到你身体姿势有所变化”。
when you're talking about this decision".

140
00:06:27,166 --> 00:06:30,026
在这方面，我的经验是，
But my experience in this is that 

141
00:06:30,026 --> 00:06:32,699
当你召集这群人
when you've got this group of people

142
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:34,600
一起聆听焦点人物的议题时,
gathered to listen around this issue,

143
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:36,383
每个人都会听到一点点
each person is going to hear 

144
00:06:36,383 --> 00:06:43,199
上帝的声音以及帮助焦点人物向前走的话语。
a little piece of God's voice, of away forward.

146
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,866
很多时候，焦点人物自己会
A lot of times, the person themselves will

148
00:06:45,866 --> 00:06:48,666
开始感觉到自己内心的明晰，
start feeling that clarity in themselves and

149
00:06:48,766 --> 00:06:50,699
而且将能够在一定程度上命名它，
will be able to name it to some degree

150
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,800
他们会这样说,
and to be able to say, 

151
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,266
“是的，当你分享的时候,
"Yes, when you shared that, 

151
00:06:53,266 --> 00:06:54,966
我真的觉得是这样的”
I really felt like that rang true",

152
00:06:54,966 --> 00:07:00,099
或者，“那感觉就在我的身体或属灵里”。
or "That felt right within my body or my spirit".

153
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,433
我曾带着对将要发生的事情的
I've come into a Clearness Committee 

154
00:07:03,433 --> 00:07:06,366
先入为主的概念进入澄心委员会，
with a preconceived notion of what's going to happen,

156
00:07:06,700 --> 00:07:10,733
但每次都被吹得天花乱坠。
and it gets blown out of the water every single time.

157
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:14,800
这种方式有点滑稽。
It's kind of hilarious that way.

159
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:19,966
我曾参加过一个澄心委员会，在那里小组
I've been on Clearness Committees where the group

160
00:07:19,966 --> 00:07:22,933
发现焦点人物对结婚感到不明晰,
found that people weren't clear to get married,

162
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,566
或者那个成员
for instance, or that membership  

163
00:07:25,566 --> 00:07:27,533
可能还需要一点时间来明晰,
might need to take a little more time,

164
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:30,500
或者可能需要召开第2、3或4次会议，
or that there might need to be 2 or 3 or 4 meetings

165
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,733
在明晰部分问题前
faced that over a number of months before

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,566
花几个月时间里面对这个问题。
we get at the clearness part of things.

167
00:07:35,566 --> 00:07:39,599
我觉得这在很多方面是有帮助的。
I think that's helpful in a couple of ways.

169
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,166
它在“是的”方面很有帮助，比如,
It's helpful in the "yes", like of,

170
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:46,566
“啊，是的，这就像个引领，所以没有点自我怀疑，没问题的，
"Ah, yes, like this was a leading, so okay self-doubt

171
00:07:46,566 --> 00:07:49,933
就像，有其他的委员会成员，
like, take that, there's a committee of other

172
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,166
他们已经倾听并听到了我的心声！”。
friends who have listened and heard!".

173
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,099
这也像,
It's also like,

174
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,133
我可以为 "不 "而欢欣鼓舞。
I can rejoice in the "no".

175
00:07:57,133 --> 00:08:00,150
比如，当澄心委员会以“等待”,
Like, when a Clearness Committee ends in a "wait",

176
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:02,966
或“那不是我想的那样”结束。
or like, "That wasn't what I thought it was".

178
00:08:04,100 --> 00:08:05,666
这就像来自上帝的声音，
Then that's coming from God

179
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:09,333
而我感觉在那个“不”
and I can feel so much more comfortable

180
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:11,533
或者那个“等等”终舒服多了，
in that "no" or in that "wait"

181
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:14,866
而不是，“我要说‘不’，或者‘等等’，
than just like, "Well I really said no, or wait,

183
00:08:14,866 --> 00:08:16,666
但这只是我自己的自我怀疑。”。
but it was just like my own self-doubt".

184
00:08:17,166 --> 00:08:18,533
通通不见了。
That's gone.

185
00:08:18,533 --> 00:08:19,999
在澄心委员会最后，
That's kinda out of the picture

186
00:08:20,066 --> 00:08:21,466
这有点出乎意料。
at the end of a Clearness Committee.

187
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:23,599
有时候，你还没得到明晰,
Sometimes you don't come to clarity,

188
00:08:23,666 --> 00:08:27,139
所以当这种情况发生时，有点令人沮丧。
so that's kind of a bummer when that happens.

189
00:08:27,139 --> 00:08:28,899
但这绝对不罕见,
But it definitely is not uncommon,

190
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,753
所以如果这种事发生在你身上，别担心,
so if that happens to you, don't worry,

191
00:08:30,753 --> 00:08:33,366
你并不是贵格会的失败者。
you're not a failure at Quakerism.

192
00:08:33,933 --> 00:08:35,533
你可以再试一次，
You can try again or

193
00:08:35,800 --> 00:08:38,520
或者你可以让从那个社区中
you can allow the wisdom that did emerge 

194
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:41,599
出现的智慧来告知你的决定。
out of that community to inform your decision.

196
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,266
在这个忠实的等待和聆听的空间里,
In this space of faithful waiting and listening,

199
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,733
坦率地用爱倾听
and frankly listening with love 

200
00:08:50,733 --> 00:08:53,699
焦点人物的问题,
for the person who has the question,

201
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:59,499
意味着当我们每个人以不同的方式
means that when we bring that love together

202
00:09:01,266 --> 00:09:06,366
将自己持有的爱凝聚在一起时，
in the different ways each individual holds that,

204
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:15,899
即使没有明晰的结果,
even if no clarity comes from it,

206
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:21,900
有一种被我们的社区所拥有的爱的感觉，
there is a sense of being held in love by our community

207
00:09:23,166 --> 00:09:25,400
这可以使即使缺乏明晰度
that can make the lack of clarity 

208
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,966
也不再像以前那么可怕。
not as scary as it used to be.
