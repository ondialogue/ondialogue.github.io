{\an5}<font size="60px">澄心委员会（二）</font>

1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,870
但直截了当地说，澄心委员会
But to cut to the chase, the Clearness Committee is 

2
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:09,279
基本上是一种探索内心存在状态的模式。
basically an inquiry model of being in the world. 

3
00:00:09,279 --> 00:00:10,530
我想说的是，
And I like to say 

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,230
特别是在学术环境中，
especially that in academic setting that

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,580
澄心委员会通过
what a Clearness Committee does with an individual 

6
00:00:15,580 --> 00:00:17,970
提出诚实而开放的问题
by way of inquiring honestly 

7
00:00:17,970 --> 00:00:20,970
帮助案主倾听自己内心
and openly into who that individual is 

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,359
以及内在导师要说什么。
and what that individuals inner teachers has to say. 

9
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,210
这也是一个学者
It's the same posture that 

10
00:00:30,210 --> 00:00:33,180
会采取的姿态，一个伟大的学者
a scholar adopts, a great scholar adopts

11
00:00:33,180 --> 00:00:35,579
对他/她所研究领域所采取的姿态。
 toward whatever it is that he or she is studying. 

12
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:38,972
如果你是一名物理学家，你在这个世界上
If you're a physicist you're not in the world 

13
00:00:38,972 --> 00:00:42,770
不是为了找到一个亚原子粒子，
to locate a subatomic particle and then tell it 

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,279
然后告诉它应该做什么或告诉它的性质是什么。
what it's supposed to be doing or tell it what its nature is. 

16
00:00:47,279 --> 00:00:49,379
伟大的物理学家实际上
Great physicists actually

17
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:53,290
是在倾听他们试图理解的事物。
listen to the thing they're trying to understand. 

18
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:55,640
他们有这样一种热情，
And they have such a passion

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,660
要根据事物本性去理解它，
about understanding that thing on its own terms 

20
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,065
而不会强加错误的分类给它。
without imposing false categories on it. 

21
00:01:05,065 --> 00:01:07,070
他们是很好的倾听者,
That they're very good listeners, 

22
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,140
伟大的学者总是很好的倾听者,
great scholars are always very good listeners, 

23
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,110
因为他们对正在研究之物
because they have such reverence and respect 

24
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:15,270
有如此的崇敬和尊重，
for whatever they are studying that 

26
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,511
他们想听它说话，
they want to hear  it into speech, 

27
00:01:17,511 --> 00:01:21,920
他们想用它自己的声音与其对话。
they wanted to speak to them in its own voice. 

28
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:25,110
坦率地说，我在大学里的困惑是，
And the  puzzlement for me in universities

29
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,750
为什么我们知道如何将
frankly has been why we know how to 

30
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:29,790
这种尊重扩展到亚原子粒子
extend that respect to subatomic

31
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,394
或文学作品或历史时期中，
particles or bodies of literature or periods of history, 

32
00:01:34,394 --> 00:01:38,065
但我们不知道如何彼此尊重。
but we don't know how to respect to each other. 

33
00:01:38,065 --> 00:01:40,990
因此，澄心委员会是一个彼此
So the Clearness Committee is an opportunity

35
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:44,404
为对方做这件事的机会，对我来说，
to do it for each other which seems right 

36
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:49,390
这似乎是正确和恰当的，而且是富有成效的生命奉献。 
and proper to me and fruitful life giving. 

37
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:53,614
从组织的角度来说，我认为
In organizational terms, I think 

38
00:01:53,614 --> 00:01:56,610
澄心委员会就像一个优秀的
the Clearness Committee is like the 

39
00:01:56,610 --> 00:01:59,789
走来走去的领导者，她会这样说,
good leader who walks around basically saying, 

40
00:01:59,789 --> 00:02:02,260
“这里发生了什么？
"What's happening here? 

41
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:06,460
你是怎么经历这一切的呢?”，
And how are you experiencing what's happening?",

42
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:10,199
而且她会非常仔细地倾听，
and listen very carefully in a way that 

43
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:14,270
以帮助人们拿起镜子照自己，
helps people hold a mirror up to themselves

44
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:18,110
并参与到自我纠正这个
and engage in that most remarkable 

45
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,780
人类最了不起的活动中。
human activity called self-correction.

46
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:25,150
就像你看着镜子里的自己，
Just as you look at yourself in the mirror 

47
00:02:25,150 --> 00:02:30,390
看看自己是否达成目标。
to see that you are missing the mark.

48
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,090
不是因为有人告诉你，你没抓住目标,
Not because someone tells you that you're missing the mark, 

50
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:37,100
而是因为你已经知道标的是什么了。
but because you already know what the mark is. 

51
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:41,100
镜子可以帮助你看到你偏离了目标。
And the mirror helps you see there you're off target.

53
00:02:41,100 --> 00:02:47,241
我认为在一个组织中进行领导，
There's a way I think of leading in an organization 

54
00:02:47,241 --> 00:02:50,040
或者帮助一个组织了解其自身有一种方式。
or of helping an organization understand its own life.

56
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,910
这更多的是关于镜像，而不是
That is much more about mirroring than it is  

57
00:02:52,910 --> 00:02:57,644
关于建议、修正、拯救和纠正每个人。
about advising, fixing, saving and setting everybody straight.

59
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:03,900
镜像是很强大的，因为当
And mirroring is powerful, because when 

60
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:06,600
人们在镜子中看到自己，
people see themselvess in the mirror and 

61
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:11,030
并参与到这种被称为自我纠正、
engage in that activity called self-correction 

62
00:03:11,030 --> 00:03:14,600
自我分析或自我理解的活动中时，
or self-analysis or self-understanding, 

63
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:20,270
其结果更有可能是永久和深刻的，
the results are much more likely to be permanent and deep 

64
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:23,370
而不是当一些局外人出现并说，
than they are when some outsider comes along and says, 

66
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:25,019
”哦，你把一切搞错了,
"Oh, you got this all wrong, 

67
00:03:25,019 --> 00:03:27,389
你最好这样做!”
better you should do it this way!",

68
00:03:27,389 --> 00:03:29,910
人们可能会做一两个星期，
which people may do for a week or two and then 

69
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,670
然后他们又恢复到其更舒服的状态中。
they'll revert to whatever it is they're more comfortable with.
