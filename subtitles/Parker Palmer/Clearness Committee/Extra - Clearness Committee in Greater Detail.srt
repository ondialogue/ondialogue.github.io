2
00:00:06,549 --> 00:00:09,370
It's hard work to think about standing 

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,039
in the tragic gap, not passively but 

4
00:00:12,039 --> 00:00:15,669
in a way that helps something happen there 

5
00:00:15,669 --> 00:00:19,509
that's for the common good.

6
00:00:19,509 --> 00:00:23,619
It's hard work to draw deep for those sources 

7
00:00:23,619 --> 00:00:25,869
of courage in our own life and to embrace 

8
00:00:25,869 --> 00:00:29,380
the fact that we both have courage and 

9
00:00:29,380 --> 00:00:33,489
are called to courage.

10
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:37,480
The question arises where does one find

11
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,390
nourishment and sustenance for that hard work? 

12
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:42,790
And I want to suggest that

13
00:00:42,790 --> 00:00:45,869
the Clearness Committee, or this way of 

14
00:00:45,869 --> 00:00:49,809
holding each other on the shoulder,

15
00:00:49,809 --> 00:00:52,330
is one answer to that.

16
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:55,000
It's not the only answer, but one answer,and an answer that 

17
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,920
in my life and in 

18
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,439
the lives of a number of people I know

19
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:02,430
has been a powerful one,

20
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:07,240
a powerful source of nurture and sustenance.

21
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,350
Let me turn to the schedule now and just walk through 

22
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:15,670
this process before we start digging 

23
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:22,479
into the depths of it. At 9:45,  

24
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:24,130
thereabouts, we're going to sit down 

25
00:01:24,130 --> 00:01:26,939
in silence in these spaces 

26
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:29,560
in a small face-to-face circle and the silence will

27
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,749
be broken by the focuse person when he

28
00:01:31,749 --> 00:01:35,530
or she is ready to begin. So right away 

29
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:38,740
our job is to hold a quiet,

30
00:01:38,740 --> 00:01:42,719
centered, focused space without chitchat.  

31
00:01:42,719 --> 00:01:44,979
For several hours this morning 

32
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:47,799
we are suspending the normal rules of social 

33
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:50,350
interaction and we're going to do

34
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:51,670
something very different 

35
00:01:51,670 --> 00:01:54,100
for reasons I'll try to explain in a moment.

36
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,389
From 9:45 to 10:00 the focused 

37
00:01:58,389 --> 00:02:00,189
person will describe his or her issue 

38
00:02:00,189 --> 00:02:02,020
while committee members listen without

39
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,990
interruption. They may stop before 10:00.

40
00:02:04,990 --> 00:02:06,850
They certainly won't go on much

41
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:07,719
longer than that 

42
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:09,970
and our job during that time is to 

43
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:12,970
listen. They will give us a clear signal 

44
00:02:12,970 --> 00:02:15,220
when they are ready to start receiving 

45
00:02:15,220 --> 00:02:18,970
questions. And then from

46
00:02:18,970 --> 00:02:22,600
10:00 to 11:30 the rule is questions only.

47
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:25,030
Committee members may not speak to 

48
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:28,990
the focus person in any way except to ask 

49
00:02:28,990 --> 00:02:33,340
brief, honest, open questions. This is 

50
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:36,280
where we're going to do some work this

51
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:40,900
morning about what is ruled out and

52
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:45,400
what is ruled in because our behavior during 

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,530
this time, our verbal behavior and our 

54
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:50,830
nonverbal behavior is very important. 

55
00:02:50,830 --> 00:02:53,990
It's the core and the heart of the process.

56
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:56,370
[Music]

57
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:59,440
Mirroring can be a very valuable moment

58
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:02,530
in this process. You've sat and listened 

59
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:05,020
deeply to this person for an hour and 

60
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:10,240
three quarters, hour and a half, and yet

61
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,490
it's also that slippery slope where we 

62
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:14,980
might slide back towards trying to 

63
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:18,220
advise, fix, save, set someone's straight. 

64
00:03:18,220 --> 00:03:21,100
And so if you can remember during this 

65
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:23,620
time that you serve this person best by 

66
00:03:23,620 --> 00:03:26,860
being a literal mirror, and I will 

67
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:29,670
illustrate what I mean.

68
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:33,370
If you say to the focus person,

69
00:03:33,370 --> 00:03:36,010
?°When you were asked this question,this is how you

70
00:03:36,010 --> 00:03:41,530
answered."  Amen, I simply invite you 

71
00:03:41,530 --> 00:03:44,080
to look at that as the subtext, 

72
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,030
the implicit message.

73
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:48,519
You don't say why you think that's

74
00:03:48,519 --> 00:03:51,310
important. You obviously think it's 

75
00:03:51,310 --> 00:03:53,370
important but you don't tell them. Why?

76
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:56,380
You don't do anything except hold up a 

77
00:03:56,380 --> 00:03:59,170
mirror that reminds them of a question

78
00:03:59,170 --> 00:04:00,790
that was asked and an answer that was given.

79
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:03,670
There's a second kind of mirroring 

80
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:06,970
where you say, "I invite you to look at

81
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:09,660
three questions and three answers

82
00:04:09,660 --> 00:04:10,870
simultaneously."

83
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:13,810
You obviously have a theory about why 

84
00:04:13,810 --> 00:04:17,350
those hang together in some way

85
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:19,779
but you are not to say what theory is.

86
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,640
You are simply to mirror that these three 

87
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,350
questions were asked and these three 

88
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,820
answers were given. And you let the focus 

89
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:30,070
person make of that whatever he or she 

90
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,800
wants to make of it.

91
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,790
Constantly the effort here is to 

92
00:04:34,790 --> 00:04:38,350
withdraw our desire to shape this

93
00:04:38,350 --> 00:04:41,300
process or to interpret what's going on

94
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,770
or to import our own wisdom and simply

95
00:04:45,770 --> 00:04:49,700
to let the person get a clear bead on 

96
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,340
the inner teacher, on their own inner wisdom.

97
00:04:52,340 --> 00:04:56,510
Body language mirroring can be 

98
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,210
very valuable. It's even trickier.

99
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:01,040
It's harder to do.

100
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:04,910
You have to be a phenomenologist to do it.

101
00:05:04,910 --> 00:05:07,040
Good mirroring would say,"When you were asked about job A,

102
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:11,210
your voice grew soft and your eyes 

103
00:05:11,210 --> 00:05:14,150
were downcast. When you were asked about 

104
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:18,530
job B, your head was erect and your voice 

105
00:05:18,530 --> 00:05:23,960
was loud."  You'll notice what I didn't do 

106
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,360
there. I didn't say,  "When you were asked 

107
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,670
about job A you seemed subdued and 

108
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:31,430
depressed. When you were asked about job 

109
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:34,090
B you seemed enthusiastic and excited.

110
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:38,990
Don't you think its job B?  Why don't you 

111
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:46,730
go sign up right now?"  The point 

112
00:05:46,730 --> 00:05:49,850
being, even though I think I know,

113
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:53,120
I have no idea what 

114
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
those downcast eyes and that soft voice really 

115
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:58,310
mean. Quite the contrary it may not be

116
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,740
depression. It may be this is the most 

117
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:03,260
serious possibility I've looked at for 

118
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:05,540
a long time and I'm considering it deeply.

119
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:09,110
I can't get inside another person and

120
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:11,870
interpret them. And my job here is to 

121
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:15,950
remember that and to not invade this 

122
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:19,130
person's soul, this person's inner space.

123
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:23,900
If the focus person invites 

124
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:28,970
mirroring, those are the disciplines we 

125
00:06:28,970 --> 00:06:31,370
need to practice and it can be enormously

126
00:06:31,370 --> 00:06:35,420
valuable in that last 15 minutes to 

127
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,970
help a person re-gather things that

128
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,460
have come from within herself or himself

129
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:44,300
and simply have a chance to look at them 

130
00:06:44,300 --> 00:06:45,150
again before

131
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:48,240
the group disbands. With five minutes 

132
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,000
left someone is going to say, "We now 

133
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,550
invite affirmations and celebrations" and 

134
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,020
I'll tell you what I told the 

135
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:57,930
focus persons last night. In the dozens and 

136
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:00,290
dozens, maybe over a hundred by now

137
00:07:00,290 --> 00:07:03,900
Clearness Committees I've done, 

138
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,820
I have never known those affirmations and 

139
00:07:05,820 --> 00:07:09,020
celebrations to be gratuitous or forced.

140
00:07:09,020 --> 00:07:12,240
They've always been authentic and deeply

141
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,090
felt. It's simply an enormous privilege 

142
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:17,460
to be in the presence of another 

143
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:23,010
person's soul and two hours later you 

144
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:24,570
will feel that privilege and you 

145
00:07:24,570 --> 00:07:27,600
will feel the mystery of the human self 

146
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:30,390
and you will want to celebrate the shared 

147
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:32,970
journey and this person who has 

148
00:07:32,970 --> 00:07:35,910
given you the gift of a peace of his or 

149
00:07:35,910 --> 00:07:37,010
her life 

150
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,250
and because we value that gift and this 

151
00:07:41,250 --> 00:07:43,920
offering that these three people are 

152
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:47,040
making to us so deeply, 

153
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:49,100
[Music]

154
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:51,810
we will abide faithfully by the rule of double 

155
00:07:51,810 --> 00:07:56,580
confidentiality, which means A) nothing 

156
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,830
said by the focused person in this group 

157
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,350
or any of the questions asked will 

158
00:08:01,350 --> 00:08:04,530
ever be repeated to another soul even if that 

159
00:08:04,530 --> 00:08:08,370
person was in the group. 

160
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:10,560
Group members will not talk about this when 

161
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:14,280
it's over. Our job when it's over is to

162
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,590
continue to hold the focus person 

163
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:18,360
in our thoughts and the 

164
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:22,650
light in whatever way you hold people. And secondly, the 

165
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:25,110
second part of double confidentiality 

166
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:28,230
is that none of us is at liberty after the 

167
00:08:28,230 --> 00:08:31,620
Clearness Committee to come up to the

168
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,600
person a day later, a week later,

169
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:36,059
a month later and say, "You remember when 

170
00:08:36,059 --> 00:08:39,650
you said this? I had a thought about that."

171
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:45,350
We hold this sacred space forever,

172
00:08:45,350 --> 00:08:50,670
henceforth and ever more.

173
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,700
We do not later invade the focused person with our fixes,

174
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:57,690
counsels, and advices.
175
00:08:57,690 --> 00:09:00,750
Focus people have said time and again that 

176
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:02,550
second part of the confidentiality rule 

177
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:05,010
liberated me to do what I needed to 

178
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:07,200
doing here,which is to have the deepest

179
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:09,530
possible conversation with myself

180
00:09:09,530 --> 00:09:13,170
knowing that it will stop there and if 

181
00:09:13,170 --> 00:09:15,420
one of them wants to come to us 

182
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:18,140
and say, "Would you sit and talk with me?"

183
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:20,910
They're at liberty to do that.

184
00:09:20,910 --> 00:09:24,230
We're not at liberty to approach them.

185
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,070
Your job as members of the committee 

186
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:32,730
this morning is to create a space that 

187
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:36,070
is to be occupied by the focused person

188
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,920
and the focused person alone for two 

189
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,139
hours. If you can remember to keep

190
00:09:44,139 --> 00:09:49,089
yourself out of that space,

191
00:09:49,089 --> 00:09:51,970
both in verbal way and in an energetic way,

192
00:09:51,970 --> 00:09:53,920
right now I'm leaning into this space, right?

193
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:56,829
My energetics are taking me to 

194
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:58,300
the middle of this because I've got a 

195
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:02,500
message I'm trying to convey.

196
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:04,089
If I'm a member of a committee this morning,

197
00:10:04,089 --> 00:10:07,839
I need to lean back, breathe deep, 

198
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,920
not lean in, and simply hold the space for this 

199
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,690
person to occupy herself or himself 

200
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:19,720
without me being in there.

201
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:23,170
This has all kinds of practical implications. 

202
00:10:23,170 --> 00:10:26,260
If the focus person starts to cry  

203
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,029
I'm likely to do that this morning 

204
00:10:28,029 --> 00:10:29,620
because I'm going to be dealing with some stuff

205
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:31,959
that touches my emotional life pretty deeply.

206
00:10:31,959 --> 00:10:35,170
Members of my committee are not 

207
00:10:35,170 --> 00:10:38,829
liberty to comfort me. They're not at 

208
00:10:38,829 --> 00:10:41,110
liberty to move into that space 

209
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,290
with a Kleenex or a hand on the arm

210
00:10:44,290 --> 00:10:48,790
that says all will be well because 

211
00:10:48,790 --> 00:10:52,089
as soom as they do that they have occupied my space

212
00:10:52,089 --> 00:10:55,149
and they have changed this from 

213
00:10:55,149 --> 00:10:58,060
my dialog with my inner teacher,

214
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:01,300
to a social relationship with them in which I now 

215
00:11:01,300 --> 00:11:04,899
have to worry about 

216
00:11:04,899 --> 00:11:06,820
what they're thinking about my condition and 

217
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:08,709
making them feel like they're good 

218
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,800
caregivers. This is exactly what 

219
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:17,350
needs not to happen. This is not your

220
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:19,560
father's Oldsmobile.

221
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:26,910
I need a space in which I can sit there 

222
00:11:26,910 --> 00:11:29,340
and ask myself what are those tears

223
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:32,730
really about and maybe some caring 

224
00:11:32,730 --> 00:11:35,010
person in the circle will ask that as an 

225
00:11:35,010 --> 00:11:37,529
honest, open question. 

226
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:40,680
"Where do you think those tears are coming from?"

227
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:43,860
That's a fair question£¬ but comforting me or 

228
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:45,810
trying to help me get rid of those tears

229
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,779
or being embarrassed on my behalf 

230
00:11:48,779 --> 00:11:51,120
about the tears is not serving me well

231
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:56,610
in this situation. Always keeping 

232
00:11:56,610 --> 00:11:58,529
yourself out of the space, leaning back, 

233
00:11:58,529 --> 00:12:01,110
and yet being fully attentive just 

234
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,310
intense with your intentionality  

235
00:12:04,310 --> 00:12:10,110
being to support me and my inner dialogue. 

236
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:14,130
I may get off a good joke. You're certainly

237
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,680
free to smile gently. 

238
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,310
You are not free to join me in raucous laughter. It's been

239
00:12:20,310 --> 00:12:21,990
pointed out to me more than once that

240
00:12:21,990 --> 00:12:24,030
I'm always the first person to laugh at 

241
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:26,600
my jokes and sometimes the only person.

242
00:12:26,600 --> 00:12:32,040
In this setting, you don't join me 

243
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:35,880
in laughter because I need a chance to ask 

244
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:38,880
myself am I using my sense of humor to

245
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:41,010
blow off an issue that's really kind of 

246
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,460
painful to me? I do that sometimes.

247
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:47,060
This two-hour period is an opportunity 

248
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:50,430
to reflect on that but that opportunity 

249
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:53,370
is taken from me if you join me in

250
00:12:53,370 --> 00:12:55,740
laughter and turn this into a social 

251
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,339
occasion. You're holding the space 

252
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,620
with a simple intentionality, a simple 

253
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:03,570
focus, a simple attentiveness, 

254
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:06,270
a remembering that it's my inner teacher 

255
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:09,620
that counts. You aren't going like this, 

256
00:13:09,620 --> 00:13:12,770
which is inattentive and disrespectful 

257
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:16,220
nor are you leaning in. You are neither 

258
00:13:16,220 --> 00:13:19,920
invading nor evading. You are simply

259
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:23,700
holding me present in intentionality 

260
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,650
that I might have a dialogue with

261
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:29,070
my inner teacher. Now, there's 

262
00:13:29,070 --> 00:13:30,470
one thing that in this regard

263
00:13:30,470 --> 00:13:32,660
before I get to the questions 

264
00:13:32,660 --> 00:13:34,970
that I talked to the focus people 

265
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,550
about last night.

266
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:39,290
You have been doing something in the 15 

267
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:41,510
minutes we've been together so far 

268
00:13:41,510 --> 00:13:43,430
that's helpful to me under these 

269
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:44,750
circumstances.

270
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,820
You've been nodding when you get it.

271
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:49,040
You've been looking puzzled 

272
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:51,200
when you don't get it. You've been giving me clues

273
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,420
about what I have to say more about 

274
00:13:53,420 --> 00:13:55,640
or what I've said enough about. Under these

275
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:59,420
circumstances that's helpful but in a 

276
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,550
Clearness Committee these nonverbal 

277
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,310
signals that we give each other are 

278
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:08,870
radically unhelpful because they turn it 

279
00:14:08,870 --> 00:14:11,330
back into a conventional social

280
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:14,270
situation where my job, and I'm 

281
00:14:14,270 --> 00:14:16,610
going to a focus person this morning, subtly 

282
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:19,130
becomes persuading you that I'm on the 

283
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:21,200
right track so that I get you going like 

284
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:24,760
this rather than like this, right?

285
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:28,580
That's hard stuff to break.

286
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:30,590
It is very hard for you, as members of the committee,

287
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:33,830
when you hear my problem and I'm 

288
00:14:33,830 --> 00:14:35,930
struggling with something not to

289
00:14:35,930 --> 00:14:38,450
look sympathetic and to nod and a smile and 

290
00:14:38,450 --> 00:14:42,500
to encourage me but in doing so,

291
00:14:42,500 --> 00:14:45,520
you maybe leading me down the worst goat trail

292
00:14:45,520 --> 00:14:50,150
of my life and depriving me of a chance

293
00:14:50,150 --> 00:14:53,720
 to find my own path. How do you deal with 

294
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:57,140
that? Simple. I've said to the focus 

295
00:14:57,140 --> 00:15:00,530
people you are at liberty to close your 

296
00:15:00,530 --> 00:15:04,490
eyes for the full two hours to 

297
00:15:04,490 --> 00:15:06,170
hear those questions with your eyes

298
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:09,440
closed, to respond to them with your eyes

299
00:15:09,440 --> 00:15:11,930
closed. If that's not comfortable you can

300
00:15:11,930 --> 00:15:13,730
look at the center of the circle 

301
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:15,680
while you hear the questions and answer the 

302
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:18,620
questions or you can look at the ceiling

303
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:21,250
or out the window.

304
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:23,990
Members of the committee are to hold 

305
00:15:23,990 --> 00:15:26,960
this person and steady attention, but the 

306
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,450
focused person is to disengage from us

307
00:15:29,450 --> 00:15:33,170
as much as possible so that 

308
00:15:33,170 --> 00:15:34,760
you are really, the focus person is really,

309
00:15:34,760 --> 00:15:36,890
having a conversation with herself or 

310
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:40,780
himself. This is very countercultural. 

311
00:15:40,780 --> 00:15:43,680
This is what you call rude 

312
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,320
under normal circumstances but in these circumstances

313
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:50,710
it's the only thing that works and 

314
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:53,110
I will tell you exactly. It came to me in a

315
00:15:53,110 --> 00:15:54,870
Clearness Committee several years ago. 

316
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:58,060
The power of this, for me as a focused 

317
00:15:58,060 --> 00:16:02,350
person, the power is that at some point in this 

318
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:05,590
in this process morning I will be 

319
00:16:05,590 --> 00:16:09,730
asked a question that will take me to 

320
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:12,580
a place of truth that 

321
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:17,710
I don't talk about. If my eyes are closed 

322
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,050
and I have gotten the message inwardly

323
00:16:20,050 --> 00:16:23,080
that this is not about persuading

324
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:26,860
anybody of anything, of seeking approval 

325
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:30,090
or being worried about disapproval, 

326
00:16:30,090 --> 00:16:34,750
I will be sitting there thinking

327
00:16:34,750 --> 00:16:37,630
the only person I have to fool here is 

328
00:16:37,630 --> 00:16:41,980
myself and why would I want to do that? I will 

329
00:16:41,980 --> 00:16:43,960
therefore be encouraged to answer

330
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:52,750
honestly. Questions only. Honest, open 

331
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:58,540
questions. I've never found an ironclad 

332
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,660
way to generalize about what an honest, 

333
00:17:01,660 --> 00:17:04,329
open question is. Here's the closest I 

334
00:17:04,329 --> 00:17:08,800
can come. An honest, open question is one 

335
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,560
you asked without possibly being able to 

336
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:14,109
sit there and think I know the right 

337
00:17:14,109 --> 00:17:15,910
answer or the best answer to this

338
00:17:15,910 --> 00:17:17,920
question and I sure hope you give it to me.

339
00:17:17,920 --> 00:17:21,940
If there's any energy like that in you,

340
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:27,430
sit on the question. Don't ask it.

341
00:17:27,430 --> 00:17:28,960
An honest, open question is one you

342
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,180
ask without possibly being able

343
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:35,860
to imagine what the right answer is.

344
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:39,730
Let me give you a couple of examples. If I 

345
00:17:39,730 --> 00:17:43,810
ask, if I'm a member of the committee

346
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:47,170
and I asked the focus person,

347
00:17:47,170 --> 00:17:49,150
"The situation you just described. How did you 

348
00:17:49,150 --> 00:17:52,280
feel about that?"

349
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,920
That's a good honest, open question. 

350
00:17:54,920 --> 00:18:01,100
It allows that person to name some emotions but if 

351
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:03,650
I listen to that list of emotions and

352
00:18:03,650 --> 00:18:08,630
I notice that anger is missing and I'm 

353
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:10,520
saying to myself, "Boy, if I'd been 

354
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,910
in that situation I would have felt angry"

355
00:18:12,910 --> 00:18:15,380
and then I asked the question, "What about

356
00:18:15,380 --> 00:18:16,270
anger?"

357
00:18:16,270 --> 00:18:19,340
That's not a good honest, open question.

358
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:21,890
Now that's a level of subtly that's

359
00:18:21,890 --> 00:18:26,480
hard to attend to but 

360
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:28,640
what I've done in effect£¬ given where 

361
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,190
that question came from,

362
00:18:31,190 --> 00:18:32,570
is I might as well have said,

363
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:34,460
"You know if I'd seen there I would have felt angry. 

364
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:39,890
Why didn't you?" That's invasive and you don't want 

365
00:18:39,890 --> 00:18:45,140
to do that. You must not do that. I said 

366
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:46,940
to the focus people last night,

367
00:18:46,940 --> 00:18:48,590
"Everybody in this circles is going to be trying very 

368
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:52,130
hard to keep the rules and sometimes

369
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:55,010
we're going to screw up and 

370
00:18:55,010 --> 00:18:57,020
we can forgive each other for that." 

371
00:18:57,020 --> 00:19:01,130
I also said to them, "If anything happens in this 

372
00:19:01,130 --> 00:19:03,890
circle that does not serve your soul you, 

373
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:06,140
the focused person, are at liberty to say that

374
00:19:06,140 --> 00:19:08,420
doesn't feel like an honest, open 

375
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:11,000
question to me or things are moving too 

376
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:13,040
fast here or I'm being pressed in an 

377
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:17,800
area that I don't want to explore."

378
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:20,990
If the focused person says that, the person 

379
00:19:20,990 --> 00:19:24,500
to whom they say it is not at liberty to 

380
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:27,200
defend herself or himself or 

381
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,530
to explain herself or himself because again,

382
00:19:30,530 --> 00:19:33,290
that's to invade the space with your agenda.

383
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:35,840
"Oh, I said that because you said this and

384
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:38,240
I thought that and therefore or 

385
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:41,330
please forgive me." Nothing.

386
00:19:41,330 --> 00:19:43,610
Your only option is listen to that,

387
00:19:43,610 --> 00:19:46,820
to sit back, and try to reenter the process 

388
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:49,700
later in a more helpful way.

389
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:52,780
That's the only option you have.

390
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:56,690
[Music]

391
00:19:56,690 --> 00:19:59,780
The pacing of the questions is important.

392
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:01,890
It's not a grilling or a 

393
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,580
cross-examination. Let there be spaces 

394
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:09,630
between questions and responses.

395
00:20:09,630 --> 00:20:11,880
The focused person may ask us to slow it 

396
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,400
down if it's moving too quickly for him 

397
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,770
or her. If you find yourself asking 

398
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,440
a question you may well feel a need for a 

399
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,710
follow-up question and that's fine, but 

400
00:20:25,710 --> 00:20:27,809
if you find yourself about to ask the 

401
00:20:27,809 --> 00:20:30,690
third question in a row 

402
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:33,179
before someone else has asked a question, you're 

403
00:20:33,179 --> 00:20:36,299
probably getting into trouble. 

404
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:41,580
Take that as a boundary marker and pull back.

405
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:50,070
Open up that space. Just a final 

406
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:53,850
image or two, there's so many images that 

407
00:20:53,850 --> 00:20:58,020
have helped me try to serve other people 

408
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:01,049
well in this process. One of them,

409
00:21:01,049 --> 00:21:03,030
frankly, is the image of sitting

410
00:21:03,030 --> 00:21:07,230
at the bedside of a dying person. I know 

411
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:08,790
that sounds a little odd but there's a 

412
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:12,630
powerful parallel here. I've done that

413
00:21:12,630 --> 00:21:15,390
a time or two and I've learned two things

414
00:21:15,390 --> 00:21:18,690
that I hope to remember.

415
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:21,090
One is that in this moment I realize, maybe for the 

416
00:21:21,090 --> 00:21:22,799
first time in a while,

417
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:27,990
that I don't have a fix for this problem.

418
00:21:27,990 --> 00:21:30,780
My job is not to fix this person up but it's to bare 

419
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:34,980
witness, to be fully present, to offer 

420
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:38,160
love and compassion in a quiet,

421
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:43,140
holding way. I'm not to invade because I can't

422
00:21:43,140 --> 00:21:47,040
do anything in there. I can just 

423
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:50,730
hold them in my presence and at the same time

424
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:54,000
I learned not to evade, that the most

425
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:56,070
disrespectful thing would be to run from 

426
00:21:56,070 --> 00:21:57,870
the room because what I'm looking at is 

427
00:21:57,870 --> 00:22:00,960
too problematic or too struggling or

428
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,260
too difficult to want to bear.

429
00:22:04,260 --> 00:22:07,020
I'mg going to keep my eyes on them.

430
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,070
I'mg going to hold them

431
00:22:08,070 --> 00:22:09,780
in my attention because it would be 

432
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,290
disrespectful not to. Maybe for some 

433
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,590
of us, remembering that this is like

434
00:22:16,590 --> 00:22:18,270
sitting at the bedside of 

435
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:21,900
a dying person, where you neither invade nor evade

436
00:22:21,900 --> 00:22:25,620
could be a helpful image.The image I

437
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:27,180
always like to close with is 

438
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,250
this very simple one, 

439
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:31,410
that for the next two hours we're going to be 

440
00:22:31,410 --> 00:22:34,110
doing something that is 

441
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,290
very much like holding a small bird in our open hands, 

442
00:22:37,290 --> 00:22:41,100
our open minds, our open hearts, and during those two

443
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,680
hours we're going to face at least three 

444
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:49,350
temptations. One is that in the first 15 

445
00:22:49,350 --> 00:22:51,660
or 20 or 30 minutes, the hands start to

446
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:53,700
close around that bird and we want to 

447
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:55,560
pluck the feathers and sort of do this 

448
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:57,810
dissecting thing we do with our minds, 

449
00:22:57,810 --> 00:23:00,420
analyze this person to pieces, try to 

450
00:23:00,420 --> 00:23:01,890
figure out what the heck is going on 

451
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,040
here and why don't they see what I see.

452
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:08,730
That's the way the mind works and we are 

453
00:23:08,730 --> 00:23:12,870
to resist that temptation. Our task is 

454
00:23:12,870 --> 00:23:15,150
simply to keep our hands open and

455
00:23:15,150 --> 00:23:19,020
hold the bird. We're not going to do dissecting 

456
00:23:19,020 --> 00:23:20,730
with our minds this morning and if we 

457
00:23:20,730 --> 00:23:22,650
don't do it with our minds we won't do it 

458
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:28,050
with our mouths. The second temptation 

459
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,150
that comes after an hour or two,

460
00:23:30,150 --> 00:23:32,160
and we're past that dissecting thing,

461
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,930
we're not sort of into the mystery of 

462
00:23:33,930 --> 00:23:36,120
another life that is being shared at

463
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:39,150
a deep level and we've come into that

464
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,480
more respectful respectful receptive mode,

465
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,900
is that the hands are going to get weary 

466
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,550
and we're going to want to lay this down

467
00:23:47,550 --> 00:23:50,610
for a while. That means the attention 

468
00:23:50,610 --> 00:23:53,640
wanders. The intentionality 

469
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,030
disappears and I just want to say to us 

470
00:23:57,030 --> 00:23:59,880
a bird is a very light thing to hold.

471
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:03,000
A soul is even lighter. We can do this 

472
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,600
for two hours. We have enough upper

473
00:24:06,600 --> 00:24:09,900
body strength to do that for two hours.

474
00:24:09,900 --> 00:24:12,590
All we have to do is pay attention to it.

475
00:24:12,590 --> 00:24:15,180
The third and final temptation comes 

476
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:18,330
toward the end, which is sort of 

477
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,780
like this. 

478
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:23,960
Please fly. Show us that you've

479
00:24:23,960 --> 00:24:27,260
solved your problem.

480
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:31,010
We put all this time and energy into you.

481
00:24:31,010 --> 00:24:34,700
We need to remember that this bird will 

482
00:24:34,700 --> 00:24:39,500
fly on its own schedule and that the fruit of

483
00:24:39,500 --> 00:24:42,350
our work this morning, the proof 

484
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:45,470
that we have done this well, is not that the bird 

485
00:24:45,470 --> 00:24:48,800
flies but that we can say we faithfully

486
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:53,630
held for two hours and when the two

487
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:54,470
hours are over

488
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:56,930
those hands can withdrawal into the heart

489
00:24:56,930 --> 00:24:58,820
and we can hold that person for a long, 

490
00:24:58,820 --> 00:25:00,170
long time to come.

491
00:25:00,170 --> 00:25:04,250
That's all we're asked to do.

492
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,890
To be faithful to the holding,

493
00:25:06,890 --> 00:25:09,980
the holding of the space, where this person can have a

494
00:25:09,980 --> 00:25:14,830
conversation about something important 

495
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:17,350
with him or herself.
