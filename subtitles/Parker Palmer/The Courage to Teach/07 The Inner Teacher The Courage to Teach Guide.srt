1
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,160
it's very important to go on an inner

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,580
journey but it's as possible to get lost

3
00:00:10,580 --> 00:00:14,090
on an inner journey as it is in an

4
00:00:14,090 --> 00:00:17,000
outward journey in the world so what we

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:18,530
try to do in the courage to teach

6
00:00:18,530 --> 00:00:21,199
retreats is to create a form of

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,140
community in which people can go inward

8
00:00:24,140 --> 00:00:26,449
they can go inward through reflecting on

9
00:00:26,449 --> 00:00:30,259
poetry or stories from some of the great

10
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:32,540
spiritual traditions that raise critical

11
00:00:32,540 --> 00:00:35,210
questions about our lives they can go

12
00:00:35,210 --> 00:00:37,700
inward in silence they can go inward

13
00:00:37,700 --> 00:00:40,250
through journaling walks in the woods

14
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:43,760
all the simple ways that human beings

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:45,980
have of becoming more reflective of

16
00:00:45,980 --> 00:00:49,340
taking time to simply listen to their

17
00:00:49,340 --> 00:00:52,730
hearts to let the world get quiet and

18
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:55,269
hear what they can hear from in here

19
00:00:55,269 --> 00:00:58,550
but but it's very important to come out

20
00:00:58,550 --> 00:01:01,070
of that solitude into a community that's

21
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:03,980
willing to hear what you think you have

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:08,270
learned and not to judge it not to tell

23
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,790
you whether it's right or wrong but to

24
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:13,159
hear it in a way that allows you to hear

25
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:16,939
yourself more deeply one of the things

26
00:01:16,939 --> 00:01:18,920
that I always say to retreat groups is

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,930
that we have a strange conceit in

28
00:01:20,930 --> 00:01:23,780
Western culture which is that just

29
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:25,759
because we've said something we think we

30
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,549
know what we've said and the most

31
00:01:28,549 --> 00:01:30,710
important things we say especially under

32
00:01:30,710 --> 00:01:33,170
these reflective conditions are often

33
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:36,310
things that that come from what I call

34
00:01:36,310 --> 00:01:40,369
the inner teacher I don't alone call it

35
00:01:40,369 --> 00:01:42,530
that I'm a Quaker and in the Quaker

36
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:46,119
tradition there's a 400 year history of

37
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:48,890
affirming that every human being has an

38
00:01:48,890 --> 00:01:51,890
inner teacher when the inner teacher

39
00:01:51,890 --> 00:01:56,360
speaks through my mouth it may take me

40
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,049
years to understand what I've just said

41
00:02:00,049 --> 00:02:02,030
and what its implications are for my

42
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,030
life but that process is going to be

43
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:07,490
greatly helped along by having a

44
00:02:07,490 --> 00:02:10,190
community of people who are willing to

45
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:13,430
hear me into speech who are who are

46
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,670
willing to let me say whatever is truly

47
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:17,770
on my heart and

48
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:21,430
mind not to judge it not to fix it not

49
00:02:21,430 --> 00:02:24,760
to advise me not to set me straight but

50
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:27,340
simply to let me hear myself at a deeper

51
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:29,680
level and that's a very special form of

52
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,270
community I think it's a community that

53
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:33,610
most people have hardly any experience

54
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:36,580
with if at all because it's a community

55
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:40,000
that that engages you but it doesn't

56
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,170
engage you with fixes or saves it

57
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:46,720
engages you with first of all listening

58
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,680
and then with honest open questions what

59
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:52,720
did you mean when you said that can you

60
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,570
say more about that this is what you're

61
00:02:55,570 --> 00:02:57,550
talking about connected in some way to

62
00:02:57,550 --> 00:03:02,500
other areas of your life this is of the

63
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,420
kind of community we try to create in

64
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,790
our retreat groups and I think it's a

65
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:08,670
kind of community that teachers find

66
00:03:08,670 --> 00:03:13,170
astonishing in its in its positive

67
00:03:13,170 --> 00:00:00,000
consequences for their lives
