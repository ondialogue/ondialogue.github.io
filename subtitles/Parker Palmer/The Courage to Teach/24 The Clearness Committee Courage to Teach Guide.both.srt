1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,200
澄心委员会是一个
The clearness committee is a process

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:11,750
在贵格会社区中有400年历史的过程，
that is 400 years old among the Quaker community

3
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:14,619
我们为教学勇气运动对其进行了改编。
that we have adapted for the courage to teach.

4
00:00:14,619 --> 00:00:17,460
简单地说它包括，
It consists to put it simply of 

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,300
一个人带着他或她
a person with an issue or a problem 

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,439
正在挣扎的问题或难题，
that he or she is wrestling with,

7
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:25,580
和其他五六个人一起，
sitting for two to three hours, 

8
00:00:25,580 --> 00:00:29,109
坐上两三个小时,
with five or six other people 

9
00:00:29,109 --> 00:00:33,300
在会议的前10分钟左右，
that focused person so-called presents his or her 

10
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:36,789
所谓的焦点人物提出他或她的问题。
problem in the first 10 minutes or so of the meeting.

11
00:00:36,789 --> 00:00:40,540
然后在接下来的两个小时，
And then for the next two hours

12
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:44,136
或者其它时间里，
or whatever time remains a long period of time,

13
00:00:44,136 --> 00:00:46,418
委员会成员被禁止
members of the committee are 

14
00:00:46,418 --> 00:00:48,970
以任何方式与焦点人物说话，
forbidden to speak to the focused person

15
00:00:48,970 --> 00:00:54,521
除了问一个诚实的开放性问题。
in any way except to ask an honest open question. 

16
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:57,160
我们会在什么构成了
And we do a lot of work on 

17
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:59,490
一个诚实的开放性问题做许多阐释。
what constitutes an honest open question.

18
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:02,310
如果我听到这个人的问题，然后说，
If I hear this person's problem and say, 

19
00:01:02,310 --> 00:01:05,050
“你有没有想过要去看心理医生?”。
"Have you thought about seeing a therapist?".

20
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:07,290
这不是一个诚实的开放性问题，
That's not an honest open question, 

21
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:11,840
因为它实际上是一个劝说和伪装,
because it is in fact a speech and disguise,

22
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,390
一个变相的建议。
a piece of advice in disguise.

23
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,789
澄心委员会是我们围绕着
And the clearness committee is where we

24
00:01:15,789 --> 00:01:18,789
不修正、不拯救、不建议、不纠正
do our deepest practice around no fixing,

25
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:22,220
而进行最深入的实践的地方。
no saving, no advising, no setting straight.

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,960
在两个小时或更长的时间里,
So for two hours or more, 

27
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,609
委员会里的五六个人
the five or six folks on that committee 

28
00:01:28,609 --> 00:01:32,119
问这个人诚实而开放的问题,
ask this person honest open questions, 

29
00:01:32,119 --> 00:01:33,310
他或她在其他人
he or she answers

30
00:01:33,310 --> 00:01:34,960
面前回答这些问题，
those questions in front of the others

31
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,229
如果他们选择这样做的话，通常他们会这样做。
if they choose to do so and normally they do.

32
00:01:38,229 --> 00:01:40,659
这里的整个意图是
And the whole intent here is 

33
00:01:40,659 --> 00:01:44,539
帮助这个人揭开
to help this person peel back whatever the layers are 

34
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:47,350
阻止他或她无法
that keep him or her from

35
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:49,229
听到内在导师的声音的那些东西。
hearing the voice of the inner teacher.

36
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:52,420
贵格会的理解是，
The Quaker understanding is that

37
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:56,859
每个人都在自己的内心深处
every person has within himself or herself 

38
00:01:56,859 --> 00:02:01,669
拥有所需的真理，拥有处理
the truth needed, the resources needed 

39
00:02:01,669 --> 00:02:04,439
这个问题或议题所需的资源，
to deal with that problem or issue 

40
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:06,219
无论它们多么令人烦恼。
no matter how vexing it is. 

41
00:02:06,219 --> 00:02:09,340
我们最不需要的就是
The last thing we need is advice

42
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,580
从别人的生活中导入建议;
imported from someone else's life; 

43
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,810
我们最不需要的就是有人说,
the last thing we need is someone saying,

44
00:02:13,810 --> 00:02:16,049
如果我是你，我会这么做,
well, if I were in your shoes, here's what I do,

45
00:02:16,049 --> 00:02:18,840
因为我们没有设身处地地为对方着想,
because we aren't in each other shoes,

46
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:21,479
我们站在自己的孤独中。
we stand in our own solitude. 

47
00:02:21,479 --> 00:02:23,910
这是一个试图尊重这一点的过程，
And this is a process that tries to honor that,

48
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:26,750
但同时在尊重独处的同时，
but at the same time while honoring solitude

49
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:29,450
将社区的资源用于
bringing the resources of community 

50
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,459
解决这个人的问题。
to bear on that person's problem.

51
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:35,729
真正需要理解的是，
What's really critical to understand  is 

52
00:02:35,729 --> 00:02:38,509
不仅使我们摆脱了
that this jerks us out not only of 

53
00:02:38,509 --> 00:02:41,719
我们的建议习惯和倾向，
our advising habits and tendencies,

54
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:43,930
而且也摆脱了我们的观念，
but also of our notion that

55
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:45,950
即我们被投身在地球上
somehow we were put on earth 

56
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,140
是为了解决彼此的问题...
to solve each other's problems... 

57
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:52,009
因此，我总是对人们说，
So I always say to people that  

58
00:02:52,009 --> 00:02:55,530
在澄心委员会期间,
during a clearness committee, 

59
00:02:55,530 --> 00:02:58,719
我们的任务只是把一个人放在我们的
the task is simply to hold a human being 

60
00:02:58,719 --> 00:03:03,180
手中和心中，就像一个人手握着一只小鸟一样。
in our hands and hearts as one would hold a small bird.

61
00:03:03,180 --> 00:03:05,829
随着委员会工作的进行,
And that as the committee goes along,

62
00:03:05,829 --> 00:03:08,955
在那两三个小时的时间里，
they're going to be at least three temptations 

63
00:03:08,955 --> 00:03:11,619
他们至少会有三个诱惑。
over that two or three hour period.

64
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:13,326
一个是，过了一段时间,
One is that after a while, 

65
00:03:13,326 --> 00:03:15,639
我们的手开始围着那只鸟转，
the hands start to close around that bird

66
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,570
我们开始解剖、分析和挑剔。
and we start to dissect and analyze and pick apart.

67
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:22,010
遇此情况，我会说，让我们与这种倾向作斗争,
And I say that let's fight that tendency,

68
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,869
让我们保持双手张开，握住那只鸟。
let's just keep the hands open and hold that bird.

70
00:03:25,869 --> 00:03:29,889
第二个诱惑是在一个小时之后，
A second temptation is going to be after an hour

71
00:03:29,889 --> 00:03:34,120
我们感受到自己的手和胳膊有点沉重，
so to kind of feel the weight of one's own hands and arms, 

72
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:36,659
这只鸟其实并不重，
the bird doesn't really weight anything, 

73
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:38,459
灵魂非常轻。
the soul is very light. 

74
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:41,079
但是拘留，主治医生
But the holding, the attending, 

75
00:03:41,079 --> 00:03:45,729
集中注意力
the paying attention it is difficult and demanding. 

76
00:03:45,729 --> 00:03:48,430
因此，我们会开始想
And so that we're going to 

77
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:51,200
把那只鸟放下来。
start wanting to put that bird down. 

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:55,170
我要求人们也要与这种倾向作斗争，
And I ask people to fight that tendency as well,

79
00:03:55,170 --> 00:03:57,620
这只是两三个小时，
it's just two or three hours and 

80
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:00,390
我们可以握着这只鸟那么久。
we can hold the bird for that long. 

81
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:02,749
然后第三个也是最后一个倾向是，
And then the third and final tendency is

82
00:04:02,749 --> 00:04:04,819
在我们和这个人
that somewhere towards the end of 

83
00:04:04,819 --> 00:04:06,549
共度了两三个小时，
the clearness committee process 

84
00:04:06,549 --> 00:04:08,739
我们问了诚实的开放性问题之后，
after we've sat with this person

85
00:04:08,739 --> 00:04:10,540
在澄心委员会过程
for two or three hours and we've asked

86
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:14,729
接近尾声的某个地方，这是很难做到的。
honest open questions and it's very hard to do this. 

87
00:04:14,729 --> 00:04:16,930
我们将开始
We will start moving

88
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:20,128
这样移动双手，飞吧，飞吧，
the hands this way, fly, fly, 

89
00:04:20,128 --> 00:04:22,869
你没有领会吗，你还不明白吗，起飞吧，
don't you get it, don't you see it, take off, 

90
00:04:22,869 --> 00:04:24,789
向我们展示你学到了什么。
show us that you have learned something. 

91
00:04:24,789 --> 00:04:26,933
我们也要抵抗这种诱惑。
And we're to fight that temptation as well.

92
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:30,370
全世界的人都被召唤
All in the world were called to do

93
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:33,710
要做的就是尊敬地对待那个人
 is to hold that person respectfully attentively. 

94
00:04:33,710 --> 00:04:38,079
并且渴望唤起
And with a desire to evoke the voice of 

95
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:39,419
那个人内心导师的声音,
that person's inner teacher,

96
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:42,689
不是为了我们，而是为了那个人的利益。
not for our sake but for that person's sake.

97
00:04:42,689 --> 00:04:45,219
等委员会程序结束后,
And when the committee process is over,

98
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,979
我们可以简单地把手收回到心里，
we can simply withdraw those hands into the heart and

100
00:04:47,979 --> 00:04:51,525
只要我们愿意，可以在我们的余生里
hold the person there for as long as we want,

101
00:04:51,525 --> 00:04:53,159
一直抱着这个人。
for the rest of our lives.

102
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:55,839
我认为这是人类
I think it's what the human self most yearns for

103
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:59,020
在这个世界上最渴望的，那就是被尊重地拥抱,
in this world is to be held respectfully,

104
00:04:59,020 --> 00:05:02,569
不是被入侵，不是被修正,
not to be invaded, not to be fixed, 

105
00:05:02,569 --> 00:05:06,810
不是被纠正，而只是被尊重地拥抱。
not to be set straight, but just to be held respectfully.

106
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,410
而当这种情况发生时，
And when that happens, 

107
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:12,500
最惊人的结果会随之而来。
the most amazing consequences ensue.
