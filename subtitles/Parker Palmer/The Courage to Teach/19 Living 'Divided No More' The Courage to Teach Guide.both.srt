1
00:00:04,810 --> 00:00:07,230
我有一个很深的个人信念，
I have a deep personal conviction and  

2
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:10,450
我想这是许多从事教学工作的人的共同信念，
I think it's shared by many in the courage to teach work 

3
00:00:10,450 --> 00:00:14,440
即人类历史上一些
that some of the greatest movements 

4
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:16,220
最伟大的运动和时刻
and moments in human history 

5
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,910
都来自于那些
have come from the lives of people who 

6
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:21,250
内心深处决定
have made a very deep inner decision to 

7
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:22,556
不再分裂的人的生活。
live divided no more.

8
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:26,460
我有时称其为罗莎 ・ 帕克斯决定，
I sometimes call it the Rosa Parks decision,  

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:29,499
因为她在我们的社会中是
because she's so emblematic in our society 

10
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:33,070
一个没有权力、地位、财富和
of someone who didn't have power and status and 

11
00:00:33,070 --> 00:00:37,504
影响力的人的象征，但她有一个自我。
wealth and clout, but who had a self.   

12
00:00:37,504 --> 00:00:41,880
1955年12月1日这天，
And one day December 1st 1955,   

13
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,380
我记得在阿拉巴马州的蒙哥马利,
Montgomery Alabama as I recollect,   

14
00:00:44,380 --> 00:00:47,590
她决定不再
she decided that she would no longer   

15
00:00:47,590 --> 00:00:50,330
在外表上表现得
behave on the outside in a way that  

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:54,130
与她内心深处对自己的了解
contradicted the truth she knew about 

17
00:00:54,130 --> 00:00:55,200
相矛盾的行为。
herselfhood on the inside.  

18
00:00:55,200 --> 00:00:58,360
她决定坐在公共汽车的前面,
She decided that she would sit at the front of the bus, 

19
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,360
因为她是个身心完整的人,
because she was a full human being,  

20
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,930
她内心知道这一点。
she knew that inwardly. 

20
00:01:01,930 --> 00:01:04,700
而现在她要把这一点向外表现出来。
And now she was going to act on that outwardly.

21
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,770
我们都知道这一行为
And we all know the huge consequences

22
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,049
所带来的巨大成果。  
that flowed from that act.   

23
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:12,479
我的意思不是说她是一个人做的，
I don't mean that she did it alone,  

24
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,379
在那个地方和时间还有很多人。
there were many other people in that place and time.

25
00:01:16,379 --> 00:01:19,180
然而就在那天，在那段旅程中，
And yet today who were on that journey 

26
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:21,179
罗莎决定不再过分裂的生活。
towards living divided no more.

27
00:01:21,179 --> 00:01:24,789
但我的意思是，如果没有像
But I do mean that without persons like 

28
00:01:24,789 --> 00:01:27,810
罗莎 ・ 帕克斯这样的人所做的
Rosa Parks making that decision and 

29
00:01:27,810 --> 00:01:31,030
并以公开的方式表现出来的决定，
manifesting it in a public way,

30
00:01:31,030 --> 00:01:33,800
人类的历史永远不会变得更好。
human history will never change for the better.
