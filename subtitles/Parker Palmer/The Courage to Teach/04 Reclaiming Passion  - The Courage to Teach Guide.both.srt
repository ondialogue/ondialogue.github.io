1
00:00:04,830 --> 00:00:09,320
我认为你首先得通过非常诚实地
I think you go about reclaiming passion

2
00:00:09,320 --> 00:00:12,960
了解你已经失去了
by first of all being very honest about 

3
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,230
多少激情来重拾激情，
how much of it you've lost which means

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:21,830
这意味着你要愿意感受自己的痛苦。
the willingness to feel your own pain. 

5
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,719
我曾经写过这样一个事实：
I've written about the fact that  

6
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:28,740
在我自己的旅程中，
in my own journey I have suffered through 

7
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,932
我经历了两次非常严重的临床抑郁症，
two very serious bouts of clinical depression 

8
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:35,970
这是我失去激情的终极表现。
which is the ultimate in the loss of passion.  

9
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:38,840
这是一种生命绝对死寂的状态，
It's a state of absolute deadness 

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,310
在其中你根本无力感受到任何东西。
in which you're not capable of feeling anything at all. 

11
00:00:42,310 --> 00:00:45,245
在我们的社会中，
And we have in our society 

12
00:00:45,245 --> 00:00:48,650
我们有很多策略来控制这种状态，
so many strategies for holding that at bay 

14
00:00:48,650 --> 00:00:52,420
否认它的存在，
denying that it's going on or  

15
00:00:52,420 --> 00:00:56,100
或者干脆让你的生活堕落到
simply letting your life degenerate into 

16
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:58,059
一种冰冷的玩世不恭的状态，
a kind of frozen cynical state,  

17
00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:01,970
或者也许给自己吃点药，
or perhaps medicating yourself,   

18
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:04,970
有些抑郁症确实需要药物治疗，
some depressions do indeed need medication,  

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,189
但我说的是一种抑郁症，
but I'm talking about a kind of depression where 

20
00:01:07,189 --> 00:01:12,390
药物治疗根本无效，开启内心旅程才有用。
medication is not the answer taking an inner journey is.

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:14,430
在这方面，我有一些个人经验，
So I have some personal experience that 

22
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:18,480
首先是要说出你面对
difficulty of...,  first of all naming your pain 

23
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:23,400
这个尴尬的事实所带来的痛苦。
of facing the awkward fact. 

24
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,890
这个事实常常让你觉得自己是个失败者，
The fact that often makes you feel like a failure

25
00:01:25,890 --> 00:01:39,190
我几乎被自己的绝望所麻痹，
that I am very nearly paralyzed by my own despair, 

26
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:35,262
但事实证明，承认这一点
but that turns out the acknowledgement of that 

27
00:01:35,262 --> 00:01:37,931
可以给我们带来巨大的解放，
turns out to be an enormously liberating step

28
00:01:37,931 --> 00:01:41,470
因为你开始承认在你的黑暗中
as you start to acknowledge your own pain

30
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,130
存在着痛苦，然后进入这种痛苦，
in your own darkness and move into it 

31
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:47,480
而不是试图绕过它或者越过它。
rather than trying to get around it or go over it. 

32
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:51,580
事实证明，在那种痛苦和绝望中，
It turns out that in that pain and despair are

33
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:56,550
有很多很多关于你的灵魂
lots and lots of clues about what your soul is

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:59,810
试图在你身上唤起什么的线索。
trying to call forth in you.  

36
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:02,860
因此，我认为重拾激情的第一步是
So step one I think in reclaiming passion is  

37
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:04,440
承认我不再拥有它，
just to acknowledge that I don't have it anymore, 

38
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:10,530
我认为这可以建立起一种
that I think can set up a yearning for a memory 

39
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:13,433
你曾拥有过的富足而充实人生记忆的向往。
that you have of when life was rich and full. 

40
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:17,550
而且可以让你开始一个漫长的过程，
And can start you in on a long process 

41
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:22,361
这个过程很难描述，
that's very hard to describe it and 

42
00:02:22,361 --> 00:02:25,420
当然也没有任何噱头或诀窍。
there certainly aren't any gimmicks or tricks about it.

44
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:30,884
这主要是通过你的记忆
It's mainly slogging in part back  

45
00:02:30,884 --> 00:02:34,660
进行部分回溯，
through your memory to reclaim,  

45
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:38,925
首先是重拾回忆，然后重拾
to recall first and then reclaim the reasons  

46
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:41,430
你为何想当老师
why you wanted to be a teacher  

47
00:02:41,430 --> 00:02:43,464
或为何想成为一个真正的人
or wanted to be a real person  

48
00:02:43,464 --> 00:02:46,460
或为何想在地球上
or wanted to feel alive and well 

49
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,400
感到活出鲜活生命的理由。
on the face of the earth in the first place.

51
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,710
我认为...， 我不知道自己如何去做这件事。
And I think it..., I wouldn't know how to do that by myself. 

52
00:02:52,710 --> 00:02:55,480
它有一个孤独的层面，
And there is a solitary dimension to it 

53
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,310
是任何人都无法避免的,
that no human being can avoid, 

54
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:03,884
但不管怎样，我们必须找到社区的形式，
but somehow we have to find forms of community 

55
00:03:03,884 --> 00:03:07,420
帮助人们保持那份孤独，
that help people hold that solitude 

56
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:10,831
尊敬和尊重那份孤独。
that honor and respect that solitude. 

57
00:03:10,831 --> 00:03:12,910
诗人里尔克曾经说过：
The poet Rilke once said, 

58
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:16,870
“爱是两颗寂寞的心，
"Love is this the two solitudes border 

59
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:19,670
相互保护，相互致敬”。
protect and salute one another".

60
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:22,100
对我来说，这一直是我心中
And for me that's always been a wonderful image

61
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:24,400
真正社区的一个美妙形象。
of what real community looks like. 

62
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,510
社区不是一个要求
Community is not a place where it's demanded

63
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,612
我要振作起来，精神抖擞
that I be up and on and cheery and 

64
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:36,930
并每时每刻为美好事物有所贡献的地方。
contributing to good at every moment, on everyday.

66
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,080
社区是这样一个地方，
Community is a place where  

67
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:42,430
在那里，不管任何情况，我都会接纳，
I can be held in whatever condition I am, 

68
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:47,460
而通过被接纳，我被赠予了空间和恩典，
and by being held I am given the space and the grace, 

69
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:53,040
帮我找到那些可让我恢复活力的内在力量。
to find those inner resources that can bring me back to life.

71
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,340
我认为在教师培训项目中,
And I think in the teacher formation program,

72
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,770
我们正在努力创造这样的社区。
we're trying to create that kind of community.

73
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:04,110
我认为这是美国生活中一种罕见的社区形式。
I think it's a rare form of community in American life. 

74
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,580
不是一个告诉你
Not a community that tells you 

75
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:11,080
应该做什么或你应该是什么的社区。
what you ought to do or what you ought to be.

77
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,830
也不是一个你想说什么
And not a community in which  

78
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:15,989
就说什么但没人倾听的社区。
you can say anything you want but nobody's listening.

79
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:19,200
而是一个参与的社区，
But rather a community of engagement 

80
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,630
在那里你被接受为你自己，
where you are accepted as you are, 

81
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:25,540
一个有着无条件的爱的社区。
a community of unconditional love.

82
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:30,970
我认为这就是我们需要的，以重拾我们的激情。
I think that's what we need to reclaim our passion.
