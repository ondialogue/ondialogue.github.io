1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,510
我想每一种形式的激情都有
Well, passion I guess in every form  

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,114
随着时间的推移而逐渐减弱的趋势。
has a tendency to damp down a little as time goes by.

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:18,220
无论是婚姻、
And whether it's passion in a marriage

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,460
友谊还是教学本身的激情，
or in a friendship or in teaching itself,

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,990
我们显然必须学会
we obviously have to learn to

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,629
以新的形式保持我们的激情，
to hold our passion in new forms 

7
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,859
而这些激情也许
that aren't perhaps quite as on 

8
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:31,810
并不像我们第一次发现
fire as they were when we first

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,670
这个人或这项工作时那样火热。
discovered this person or this work.

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,040
在我看来，激情变成了爱，
Passion becomes love it seems to me,  

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,970
变成了我们学会
it becomes that steady flame of caring 

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,550
在生活中保持的
about someone or something  

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,910
对某人或某事的关心的稳定火焰。
that we learn to keep alive in our lives. 

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,200
吹熄火焰的
What blows the flame out  

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,730
部分原因是外部环境，
is partly external circumstances,  

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,490
部分原因是管理者
it's partly administrators who 

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,760
不理解培养从事工作的
don't understand the importance of  

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,800
人的激情的重要性，
nurturing passion in the people doing the work,  

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,938
部分原因是社会想把教师
it's partly a society which wants to use teachers 

20
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,619
作为所有其他问题的替罪羊。
as a scapegoat for all its other problems. 

21
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:18,180
都是因为这些外在的挫折。
It's all of these external discouragements.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,681
但我也认为，在人类生活中，
But I also think that in human life, 

23
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,619
有一段时间你不得不说，
there comes a time when you have to say

24
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:28,689
风在我周围吹得又冷又猛,
the winds are blowing cold and hard around me,

25
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,859
但我不必让内心的火焰熄灭。
but I don't have to let that inner flame go out.

26
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,699
事实上，我要对自己的生活负责，
In fact I'm responsible for my own life

28
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:39,639
我有责任让火焰继续燃烧。
and I'm responsible for keeping that flame alive. 

29
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:43,350
而当我努力改变
And while I work to to change  

30
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,030
社会的外部条件时，
the external conditions in the society,   

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,719
我仍然需要在一个内在的旅程中，
I still need to be on an inner journey 

32
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,179
我自己的身份完整和
where the question of my own integrity 

33
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,259
我自己对生活的投资的问题
and my own investment in life 

34
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,880
成为一个比这些其他人
becomes a much more important question 

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,490
试图对我做什么的问题
than the question of what are these 

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,530
更重要的问题。 
other people trying to do to me.  

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,494
所以你在成年后，
So you come to a point in adulthood I think 

38
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,090
我认为你做出的最关键的决定是：
where the most critical decision you make is, 

39
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,000
“我是要通过屈服于
"Will I conspire in my own diminishment

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,809
这些外部因素来阴谋削弱自己，
by succumbing to these external versus

42
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:23,210
还是要想办法进行内在的旅行，
or will I find ways to go on an inner journey

43
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,850
在我周围聚集一个支持我的社区，
and to gather around me a community of support

44
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,520
帮助保持这种火焰的活力，
that will help keep  that flame alive

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,860
这种身份完整以及承诺的火焰”。
that flame of integrity that flame of commitment".

46
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,456
我不知道成人生活中还有
I don't know of any more important question

47
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,460
什么问题比这更重要。
in adult life than that.

49
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,069
我认为我们在 "教学勇气 "
And I think that what we're trying to do 

50
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,770
项目中要做的是，
in the courage to teach project is  

51
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,839
帮助那些想为自己和
to help teachers who want to   

52
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,940
自己的职业负责的教师找到接地气的、
take that responsibility for themselves and  

53
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,299
负责任的、有力量的方法来做这些事情。
their vocation to find grounded responsible.

We must be willing to get rid of the life we planned so as to have the life that is waiting for us.
67
我们必须心甘情愿放弃我们所计划的生活，才能迎来正在等待我们的生活。
