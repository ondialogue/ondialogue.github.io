1
00:00:04,870 --> 00:00:08,510
我想每一种形式的激情都有
Well, passion I guess in every form  

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:14,114
随着时间推移而逐渐减弱的趋势。
has a tendency to damp down a little as time goes by.

3
00:00:14,114 --> 00:00:18,220
无论是婚姻、
And whether it's passion in a marriage

4
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:22,460
友谊还是教学本身的激情，
or in a friendship or in teaching itself,

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,990
我们显然必须学会
we obviously have to learn to

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,629
以新的形式保持我们的激情，
to hold our passion in new forms 

7
00:00:27,629 --> 00:00:29,859
而这些激情也许
that aren't perhaps quite as on 

8
00:00:29,859 --> 00:00:31,810
并不像我们第一次发现
fire as they were when we first

9
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:35,670
这个人或这项工作时那样火热。
discovered this person or this work.

10
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:39,040
在我看来，激情变成了爱，
Passion becomes love it seems to me,  

11
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,970
变成了我们学会
it becomes that steady flame of caring 

12
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:45,550
在生活中保持活力的那种
about someone or something  

13
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:50,910
关心某人某事的稳定火焰。
that we learn to keep alive in our lives. 

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,200
吹熄火焰的
What blows the flame out  

15
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,730
部分原因是外部环境，
is partly external circumstances,  

16
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:01,490
部分原因是管理者
it's partly administrators who 

17
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,760
不理解培养从事
don't understand the importance of  

18
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,800
工作之人的激情的重要性，
nurturing passion in the people doing the work,  

19
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,938
部分原因是社会想把教师
it's partly a society which wants to use teachers 

20
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:14,619
作为所有其它问题的替罪羊。
as a scapegoat for all its other problems. 

21
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:18,180
人们认为所有这些外在挫折磨灭了激情。
It's all of these external discouragements.

22
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:20,681
但我也认为，在人类生活中，
But I also think that in human life, 

23
00:01:20,681 --> 00:01:24,619
有一段时间你不得不说，
there comes a time when you have to say

24
00:01:24,619 --> 00:01:28,689
外在的风吹得又冷又猛,
the winds are blowing cold and hard around me,

25
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:32,859
但我不必让内心的火焰熄灭。
but I don't have to let that inner flame go out.

26
00:01:32,859 --> 00:01:36,699
事实上，我要对自己的生活负责，
In fact I'm responsible for my own life

28
00:01:36,699 --> 00:01:39,639
我有责任让这束火焰继续燃烧。
and I'm responsible for keeping that flame alive. 

29
00:01:39,639 --> 00:01:43,350
当我努力改变
And while I work to to change  

30
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:46,030
社会的外部条件时，
the external conditions in the society,   

31
00:01:46,030 --> 00:01:48,719
我仍然需要在一个内在的旅程中，
I still need to be on an inner journey 

32
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,179
我自己的身份完整和
where the question of my own integrity 

33
00:01:52,179 --> 00:01:55,259
我自己对生活的投资的问题
and my own investment in life 

34
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,880
成为一个比其他人
becomes a much more important question 

35
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,490
试图要对我做些什么的问题
than the question of what are these 

36
00:02:00,490 --> 00:02:03,530
更重要的问题。 
other people trying to do to me.  

37
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:07,494
因此，我认为在成年后，
So you come to a point in adulthood I think 

38
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:11,090
你要做出的最关键的决定是：
where the most critical decision you make is, 

39
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:15,000
“我是要通过屈服于
"Will I conspire in my own diminishment

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,809
这些外部因素来密谋削弱自己，
by succumbing to these external versus

42
00:02:18,809 --> 00:02:23,210
还是要想办法进行内在探索，
or will I find ways to go on an inner journey

43
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:26,850
在我周围聚集一个支持的社区，
and to gather around me a community of support

44
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:29,520
帮助保持这把火焰，
that will help keep  that flame alive

45
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,860
也就是身份完整以及承诺之火的活力”。
that flame of integrity that flame of commitment".

46
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:36,456
我不知道成人生活中还有
I don't know of any more important question

47
00:02:34,989 --> 00:02:38,460
什么问题比这更重要。
in adult life than that.

49
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:42,069
我认为，我们在 "教学勇气 "
And I think that what we're trying to do 

50
00:02:42,069 --> 00:02:45,770
项目中要尽可能去做的是，
in the courage to teach project is  

51
00:02:45,770 --> 00:02:48,839
帮助那些想为自己和
to help teachers who want to   

52
00:02:48,839 --> 00:02:51,940
自己的职业负责的教师找到
take that responsibility for themselves and  

53
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:58,419
接地气的、负责任的、
their vocation to find grounded responsible

53
00:02:58,519 --> 00:03:02,816
有力量的方法来做这些事情。
and empowering ways to do all of that.
