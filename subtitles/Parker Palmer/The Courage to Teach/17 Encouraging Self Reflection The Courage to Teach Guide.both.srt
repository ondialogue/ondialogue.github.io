1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:08,109
In many ways the kind of community 

2
00:00:08,109 --> 00:00:10,844
we're trying to create in the courage to teach

3
00:00:10,844 --> 00:00:15,670
is a community that is devoted to

4
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:19,100
encouraging self-reflection.

5
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:22,500
Because the human self, 

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,779
what Thomas Merton called true Self, 

6
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,093
I don't mean the ego, 

7
00:00:26,093 --> 00:00:29,530
I don't mean the fancy designs we have for,

8
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:32,769
how we ought to look or how we ought to succeed 

9
00:00:32,769 --> 00:00:34,869
or how much money we ought to be making 

10
00:00:34,869 --> 00:00:36,900
or how we ought to be liked. 

11
00:00:36,900 --> 00:00:40,930
I mean that  that true self that is

12
00:00:40,930 --> 00:00:43,620
the core of every person, 

13
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:45,820
that's the gift we have to give. 

14
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:49,150
And we are trying to create a form of community 

15
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:52,310
that invites self-reflection in order to 

16
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:55,500
put people in fuller possession of that gift. 

17
00:00:56,330 --> 00:00:58,260
Thomas Merton said it well, he said, 

18
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,130
we are called to give our hearts to the world,

19
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:02,270
but first we have to have our hearts 

20
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:03,779
in our own possession. 

21
00:01:03,779 --> 00:01:06,090
You can't give what you don't have.

22
00:01:06,290 --> 00:01:09,549
And so this is a two-year process to  

23
00:01:09,549 --> 00:01:14,207
recover the gift you arrived here with at birth.

24
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:17,820
But may well have lost in the intervening time.

25
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,079
Now the house of that are many and various.

26
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:29,489
One thing I love that we do a lot of 

27
00:01:29,489 --> 00:01:31,692
is we put what we call a third thing 

28
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:34,694
in the middle of the communal circle.

29
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:38,870
The third thing is a poem or a teaching story 

30
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:41,620
from one of the great spiritual traditions,

31
00:01:41,620 --> 00:01:47,174
Taoism, Hasidic, Judaism, the New Testament, Sufi stories.

33
00:01:47,274 --> 00:01:49,676
We use a range of materials.

34
00:01:49,676 --> 00:01:51,445
We put a third thing 

34
00:01:51,445 --> 00:01:53,920
in the center of the circle carefully chosen,

35
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:58,219
because that third thing carries a theme or an issue

36
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:01,355
that we're wanting people to be self-reflective about. 

38
00:02:01,355 --> 00:02:04,729
And the facilitator's task is 

39
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:08,462
through a dialogical process of questioning,

40
00:02:08,462 --> 00:02:12,000
is to help that community of teachers 

41
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,020
weave a tapestry of understanding about

43
00:02:17,020 --> 00:02:20,607
where their lives intersect that third thing.

44
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:22,680
I give you a concrete example. 

45
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:25,410
We use a poem by May Sarton. 

46
00:02:26,150 --> 00:02:30,920
... is a great poet, called 'Now I become myself'.

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,510
It's fifteen or twenty lines long

48
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:36,400
and I don't have it all committed to memory,

49
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:39,330
but I give you the first four lines:

50
00:02:39,530 --> 00:02:41,830
"Now I become myself, 

50
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,966
it's taken time, many years and places. 

51
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:49,110
I have been dissolved and shaken,

52
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:51,850
worn other people's faces..."

53
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,470
You don't have to put much more than 

54
00:02:55,470 --> 00:02:58,150
those few lines in the center of the circle

55
00:02:58,150 --> 00:03:01,090
and ask some questions about how those

56
00:03:01,090 --> 00:03:04,620
lines intersect the lives of the people sitting there.

57
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,261
To evoke the most amazing range of reflections 

58
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:11,040
about how long it takes to become the self 

59
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,270
that you were when you got here,

60
00:03:13,270 --> 00:03:16,430
that you lost somewhere along the line,

61
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:20,440
about those dissolving and shaking moments in life

63
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:23,040
where everything falls apart and

64
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:24,840
it seems like all is lost.

65
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:28,040
But out of that re-emerges true self, 

66
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,550
about wearing other people's faces, 

67
00:03:31,550 --> 00:03:33,150
sometimes for better, 

67
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:35,150
sometimes for worse when you're young,

68
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:38,510
sometimes it's great to have a good face to wear, 

69
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,910
when you don't yet know your own,

70
00:03:39,910 --> 00:03:43,660
the face of an admired teacher or a parent or friend. 

71
00:03:43,660 --> 00:03:46,630
But as we grow older, wearing our own faces,

72
00:03:46,630 --> 00:03:50,500
becomes the most important piece of work we have to do.

74
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:54,200
But we put a third thing in the center of the circle,

75
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,670
the task is not to ask as one might do in a lit crit class, 

76
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:01,710
what it may certain mean by that 

77
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:04,210
or how did that relate to mace art in lives,

78
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:05,920
all of that is irrelevant here.  

79
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:09,190
The task is to allow that third thing 

80
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,284
to invite the voice of the inner teacher 

81
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:13,620
in the people in the circle 

82
00:04:12,850 --> 00:04:16,823
to come forth and to speak about things 

83
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:20,530
that it might not otherwise be able to speak about. 

84
00:04:20,530 --> 00:04:22,200
It's very interesting that 

85
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,384
you can say things about that poem, 

86
00:04:24,384 --> 00:04:26,870
which are really things about you, 

87
00:04:26,870 --> 00:04:30,460
without ever talking about yourself directly.

89
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:33,340
But we all know that that's who we're talking about.  

90
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:36,543
Poems and stories are like Rorsa's tests. 

91
00:04:36,543 --> 00:04:39,220
 and when people respond to them.

92
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,810
They're saying a great deal about themselves. 

93
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:43,600
 And in this form of community 

94
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,086
where nobody's gonna jump on you for what you said 

95
00:04:46,086 --> 00:04:48,060
or nobody's gonna try to save you, fix you 

96
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,060
or set you straight.

97
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:52,400
You have a chance to hear yourself at a new level.  

98
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,430
And you go to bed that night thinking,

99
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:58,100
"Oh, my goodness,  I just realized something 

100
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:01,134
that I need to work with here,

101
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:02,380
something about who I am,

102
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:05,289
something about my woundedness 

103
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:08,610
or something about my passion that 

104
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:11,590
the inner teacher is trying to tell me. 

105
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:14,180
And now I need to pay attention... 

105
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:28,180
Journaling, of course is

106
00:05:28,180 --> 00:05:31,530
a method of an approach to inner reflection 

107
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,130
that has been used in a lot of 

108
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:37,604
different traditions and schools of thought.

109
00:05:37,604 --> 00:05:40,382
And I think what it does is to allow you 

110
00:05:40,382 --> 00:05:43,720
to have a conversation with yourself.

112
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,100
I think external conversation is enormously valuable,

113
00:05:48,100 --> 00:05:51,419
I'm constantly learning from other people.

114
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,219
And a lot of that learning from other people

115
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:57,100
goes on in the courage to teach groups.

116
00:05:57,100 --> 00:06:00,480
But there is finally a conversation

117
00:06:00,480 --> 00:06:02,596
we need to have with ourselves:

118
00:06:02,596 --> 00:06:04,400
"Why did I do that?

119
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:05,640
Why did I say that? 

120
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:07,219
What did I mean when I said that? 

121
00:06:08,219 --> 00:06:10,480
Am I going to do it differently tomorrow?". 

122
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:14,279
These are things I have to ask myself and 

123
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:20,413
I have to listen to answers that I don't necessarily know.

124
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,980
I know that some people who teach journaling

125
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:27,420
encourage a process of imaginative reflection

126
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:30,280
in which you have a dialogue between

127
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:32,192
two different parts of yourself.

128
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,940
And people start doing that

129
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,650
thinking well this is kind of silly

130
00:06:35,650 --> 00:06:38,949
because I'm in charge of everything

131
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:42,030
that's being said here why a dialogue.

132
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:44,210
But after a very little while 

133
00:06:44,210 --> 00:06:47,910
they're discovering that the partner in that dialogue

134
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:51,750
is saying things that they didn't know, they had to say.

136
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:55,650
So there's live learning going on from within ourselves.

137
00:06:55,650 --> 00:06:56,760
I think one of the most

138
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:58,820
exciting experiences in life is 

139
00:06:58,820 --> 00:07:03,600
to understand that I am a walking community

140
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:07,770
of many voices of many intersecting

141
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:11,120
lives and forces, past present and future.

142
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,170
I'm a one person pluralism, 

143
00:07:14,170 --> 00:07:16,350
I'm not a monolith,

144
00:07:16,350 --> 00:07:20,410
I don't speak even to myself with one voice.

145
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:23,680
And to understand that what I've got in there is

146
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,980
a city, at least a neighborhood that

147
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,584
needs to have some good block meetings,

148
00:07:31,584 --> 00:07:38,060
some good dialogues to sort itself out.

149
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:42,150
And to listen to the diversity of voices that

151
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,210
any human being contains.

152
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:45,230
That's a great thing and 

153
00:07:45,230 --> 00:07:48,600
a very exciting part of the human journey.
