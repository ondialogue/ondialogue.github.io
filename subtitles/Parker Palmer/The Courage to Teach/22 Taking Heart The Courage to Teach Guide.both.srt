1
00:00:04,840 --> 00:00:07,810
六年来，我们发现，
What we are finding in the six years 

2
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,550
在全国各地与这些了不起的人
that we've been doing courage to teach retreats 

3
00:00:10,550 --> 00:00:13,280
一起参与教学勇气静修会，
with these amazing folk around the country

4
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:20,590
有一些可以确定的结果，其形式是...
is that there are nameable definable outcomes in the forms of...  

6
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:25,200
首先，学生认为这些教师的教学
first of all, students perceiving these teachers as 

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,430
更多来自他们自己，
teaching more from who they are, 

8
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:32,300
为学习创造更多好客的课堂空间，
creating more hospitable classroom spaces for learning

9
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:34,930
因为教师自己在他们的
because the teachers themselves are  

10
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,740
角色中更自在，
more at home in their role and 

11
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:41,310
更能够看到学生的心，
more able to see the heart of the student 

12
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:43,944
因为他们在看到自己的心方面得到了帮助。
having had help in seeing their own hearts.

13
00:00:43,944 --> 00:00:46,350
所以，在最重要的方面，
So they become better teachers, 

14
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:49,520
即忠实和良好地服务于
in the most important way that counts,

15
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:51,219
年轻人生命的能力上，
the capacity to serve the 

16
00:00:51,219 --> 00:00:55,560
他们成为了更好的教师。
life of a young person faithfully and well.

17
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,540
如果我有机会在一个非常大的
If I had a chance to address  

18
00:00:57,540 --> 00:01:00,760
大厅里对满是萎靡不振的教师讲话，
a very large hall full of dispirited teachers, 

19
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,169
我首先想说的是:
I'd first want to say this:  

20
00:01:03,409 --> 00:01:06,510
我知道，你们所有人都是
I know that all of you came into teaching   

21
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:09,580
通过心灵的运动进入教学领域的，
through a movement of the heart,  

22
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:11,459
你们想把自己的心交给世界；
you wanted to give your heart to the world.  

23
00:01:11,759 --> 00:01:13,780
我知道你们在这里，
I know that you're all here now   

24
00:01:13,780 --> 00:01:19,090
因为我们外围和内心的环境
because conditions around us and inside of us   

25
00:01:19,090 --> 00:01:20,749
让我们失心了。
caused us to lose heart. 

26
00:01:20,749 --> 00:01:23,049
我想问你们的问题是,
The question I want you to ask is,  

27
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:25,769
“是否有一种方法可以重新获得心，
"Is there a way to take heart again, 

27
00:01:25,769 --> 00:01:28,209
以便你们可以再次做
so that you can once more do what 

28
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:29,870
优秀教师一直在做的事情，
good teachers always do,  

29
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:32,600
那就是把心交给学生”。
which is to give heart to their students".  

30
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,440
我想说的是，这个问题有一个答案。
And I'd want  to say there's an answer to that question. 

31
00:01:35,440 --> 00:01:38,030
我已经亲眼看到了这一点，
And I've seen it with my own eyes,  

32
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,750
它就在我在全国各地
it's in the colleagues of yours whom I've met 

33
00:01:40,750 --> 00:01:42,729
遇到的你们的同事身上，
around the country from inner-city 

34
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:45,729
从巴尔的摩到沃斯堡，从德克萨斯到布里顿，
Baltimore to Fort Worth, Texas to Britton's Neck

35
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:51,129
从卡罗莱纳州到西雅图，到新墨西哥州的阿尔伯克基。
Carolina to Seattle to Albuquerque New Mexico.  

37
00:01:51,129 --> 00:01:54,170
同事们正以社区的
Colleagues who are coming together  

38
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:56,329
形式走到一起。 
in forms of community.  

39
00:01:56,329 --> 00:01:57,830
我亲眼看到，
I've seen with my own eyes,  

40
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:01,080
全国各地的老师聚在一起，
teachers around the country coming together 

41
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:06,500
致力于培养任何人类最终
committing to cultivating the only source of power  

42
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:08,500
拥有的唯一力量源泉，
any human being ultimately has,  

43
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:10,090
那就是心灵的力量，
which is the power of the heart,

43
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,532
灵魂和精神的力量。
the power  of the soul and the spirit. 

44
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:17,140
而在由教师同伴组成的社区中这样做，
And doing that in communities of fellow teachers 

45
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,830
可以帮助他们倾听自己的心声，
who can help them listen to their hearts,

46
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:22,349
让他们对自己所听到的东西保持诚实，
keep them honest about what they're hearing

47
00:02:22,349 --> 00:02:25,940
并采取下一步措施，
and take next steps towards 

48
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,459
重拾教学勇气。
regaining the courage to teach.
