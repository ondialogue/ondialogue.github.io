1
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:11,550
内心的旅程很重要但也很危险,
The inner journey is important but also dangerous,

2
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,530
我需要进去看看我的内心,
I need to go in to find out what's on my heart,

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:18,860
我需要进去听听内在导师的声音。
I need to go in to hear the voice of the inner teacher.

4
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:20,050
但危险在于，
But the danger is that

5
00:00:20,050 --> 00:00:23,860
我将只听到我想听到的东西，
I will hear only what I want to hear,

6
00:00:23,860 --> 00:00:27,579
没有人在那里
that there will be no one 

7
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:30,669
质疑我是否真的  
there to question me about whether 

8
00:00:30,669 --> 00:00:32,500
听到了这些东西。
that's what I'm really hearing.   

9
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,170
危险还在于我可能会听到
The danger also is that I might hear 

10
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,490
一些深刻的真理，
something profoundly true,  

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,210
但是因为没有其他人来讲述。
but by not having anyone else to tell it,

12
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:45,220
我有一个更好的机会忽略它,
I have a better opportunity to ignore it, 

13
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:48,290
不听从那个声音。
to not follow that voice.  

14
00:00:48,290 --> 00:00:52,560
因此，我们希望人们在社区中
So we want people to take that inner journey in 

15
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:56,320
进行这种内在的旅行，
community so that the community can ask 

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,140
以便社区可以向他们提出那些可能
them those questions that might take 

17
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:01,540
带他们深入自己的真理的问题，
them deeper into their own truth, 

18
00:01:01,540 --> 00:01:04,970
带他们穿过幻觉，带他们超越虚假，
take them past illusion and take them past falsehood 

19
00:01:04,970 --> 00:01:07,510
进入对他们来说更深刻的真理。
into what is more deeply true for them.

20
00:01:07,510 --> 00:01:10,940
我们希望他们有一个社区，
And we want them to have a community

21
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:13,340
在这个社区里，他们可以说出
in which they can say the truths 

22
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,790
他们所触及的真理，
that they have touched in a way 

23
00:01:15,790 --> 00:01:19,212
当你回去工作
that they makes it harder to forget those truths 

24
00:01:19,212 --> 00:01:20,979
或在生活中迈出下一步时，
when you go back to work or 

25
00:01:20,979 --> 00:01:24,220
他们会更难忘记这些真理。
when you take those next steps in your life.

26
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,060
我认为社区最古老的功能之一，
I think one of the most ancient functions of community

27
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:32,360
我们在结婚仪式上也这样做，不是吗？
and we do it in marriage ceremonies, don't we? 

29
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:36,520
也就是说我们在这些朋友面前
It is to say we are making this private 

30
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,490
做出这个私人承诺。
commitment in front of these our friends. 

31
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:43,240
这应该是为了加强承诺，
And that's supposed to strengthen the 

32
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:46,659
而且在许多方面确实如此，
commitment and in many ways it does,  

33
00:01:46,659 --> 00:01:51,149
当你在公共场合证明了一些事情时。
when you have attested to something communally.
