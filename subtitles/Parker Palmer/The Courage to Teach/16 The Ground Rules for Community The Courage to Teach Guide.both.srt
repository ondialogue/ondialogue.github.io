1
00:00:04,860 --> 00:00:07,210
我想我在
One of the the thing that 

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:09,210
教学勇气运动中
I guess I'm most devoted to 

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:11,511
最执着的事情之一
in the courage to teach movement  

4
00:00:11,511 --> 00:00:13,780
就是创造一种社区形式，
is to create a form of community 

5
00:00:13,780 --> 00:00:17,269
其中有几条基本规则。
in which there are several basic ground rules. 

6
00:00:17,269 --> 00:00:19,152
我经常这样总结，
And the way I often sum them up is 

7
00:00:19,152 --> 00:00:22,320
在这个社区里，没有修正,
in this community there will be no fixing,  

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:22,956
没有拯救,
there will be no saving, 

8
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:24,691
没有建议,
there will be no advising, 

9
00:00:24,691 --> 00:00:26,693
没有纠正。
there will be no settings straight. 

10
00:00:26,693 --> 00:00:29,200
如果你排除掉这四件事情,
Now if you eliminate those four things, 

11
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,932
我们大多数人都不清楚
most of us haven't got the foggiest 

12
00:00:31,932 --> 00:00:33,600
该如何处理彼此之间的关系，
idea what to do with one another,

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,329
因为我们觉得我们是在
because we feel somehow we're in the

14
00:00:36,329 --> 00:00:39,873
修正、建议、拯救和纠正的事情。
business of fixing, advising, saving and setting straight.

15
00:00:39,873 --> 00:00:42,009
但是当你创建一个
But when you create a community

16
00:00:42,009 --> 00:00:44,611
禁止这些行为的社区时，
in which those behaviors are outlawed,

17
00:00:44,611 --> 00:00:48,660
你就为人们创造了巨大的解放，
you create enormous liberation for people 

18
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,151
让他们真正地探索自己的真相是什么。
to really explore what their truth is.

19
00:00:51,151 --> 00:00:53,909
这并不意味着善意的忽视,
This doesn't mean benign neglect,

20
00:00:53,909 --> 00:00:55,890
也不意味着我在
it doesn't mean that I said 

21
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:58,125
你说话或说你的真相时，
while you're talking or saying your truth 

22
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:59,399
盯着窗外看。
and stare out the window.

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,262
我与你交互，听你说话，
I'm engaged with you, I listen to you, 

24
00:01:02,262 --> 00:01:04,800
我试着接受你所说的一切。
I try to receive what you're saying. 

25
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,310
我可能想问你一个
And I may want to ask you 

26
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:11,710
关于它的诚实的开放性问题：
an honest open question about it: 

27
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:14,210
“是什么导致你说出你刚才所说的话？”，
what leads you to say what you just said 

27
00:01:14,210 --> 00:01:17,480
或者说，“你的生活中哪来的这些？”，
or where does that come from in your life 

28
00:01:17,480 --> 00:01:21,430
或者说，“你刚才所说的话
or what implications do you think

29
00:01:21,430 --> 00:01:24,520
对你的生活有什么影响？”
what you've just said has for your life.

30
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:28,140
像我们在教学勇气运动中一样，
It's very important to work as we do

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,300
如何提出诚实的开放性问题
in this courage to teach movement 

32
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:34,430
是非常重要的工作。
on how to ask honest open questions.

33
00:01:34,430 --> 00:01:37,364
因为我们事实上被训练去问一些问题，
Because we are trained in fact to ask questions

34
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:40,120
这些问题是我们变相的
that our speeches in disguise 

35
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,370
演说或建议和变相的修正。
or advices and fixes in disguise.

36
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:46,573
因此，如果你说了一些
So if you say something that about

37
00:01:46,573 --> 00:01:48,308
关于你正在挣扎的问题，
an issue you're struggling with,

38
00:01:48,308 --> 00:01:50,143
而我看着你说:
and I look at you and say:

39
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:52,680
“你有没有想过去看心理医生?”
"Have you thought about seeing a therapist?", 

40
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,250
这就不是一个诚实的开放性问题。
that's not an honest open questions.

41
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:57,050
我坐在这里想,
I'm sitting here thinking, 

42
00:01:57,050 --> 00:01:59,350
她应该去看心理医生。
she ought to see a therapist. 

43
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,690
对于这样一个问题，我所做的是
And what I do with a question like that is

44
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,510
试图在提问的掩护下
to try to fix you or save you 

45
00:02:06,510 --> 00:02:09,169
修正你或拯救你。
under the cover of asking a question. 

46
00:02:09,169 --> 00:02:12,930
像这样的问题，你有没有想过
Questions like that have you thought about seeing

47
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:15,930
看心理医生，或者你看不出来这是你母亲的问题吗，
a therapist or can't you see it's your mother

49
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:19,039
或者这里有一本你应该读的书，
or here's a book you ought to read, 

51
00:02:19,039 --> 00:02:20,941
为什么你还没有读。
why haven't you read it yet. 

52
00:02:21,941 --> 00:02:26,799
这些问题有很大的力量来关闭灵魂，
Those questions have great power to shut down the soul,

53
00:02:26,799 --> 00:02:31,800
关闭内心老师的声音。
to shut down the voice of the inner teacher.

54
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,780
诚实的开放性问题会邀请
Honest open questions invite

55
00:02:34,780 --> 00:02:38,950
内心的声音进行更充分的表达。
that inner voice into fuller expression.

56
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,799
我所说的诚实的问题是指，
By an honest question I mean 

57
00:02:41,799 --> 00:02:43,629
当我问这个问题时，我不是坐在这里
I'm not sitting here when I ask it

58
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:45,760
想知道这个问题的正确答案，
thinking I know the right answer to this

59
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,669
我当然希望他或她能给我答案。
and I sure hope that he or she gives it to me.

60
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:50,570
我所说的开放性问题是指，
And by an open question I mean 

61
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,069
它不会把你逼到角落，
one that doesn't back you into a corner

62
00:02:53,069 --> 00:02:57,190
我要么提出解决方案修正，
where I'm proposing either the fix or

63
00:02:57,190 --> 00:02:59,920
要么提出修正的方向，
the direction of a fix and you have to

64
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,650
如果你想保住自己的地盘，你必须就得跟我对着干。
kind of fight against me if you want to hold your own turf.

65
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,220
这是一门巨大的艺术。
It's an enormous art.

66
00:03:06,220 --> 00:03:11,019
但对我来说，它与我对人类
But it is for me related to my

67
00:03:11,019 --> 00:03:13,694
灵魂的理解有关。
understanding of the human soul.

68
00:03:13,694 --> 00:03:17,379
我有一个非常生动的
I have a very vivid formini image of 

69
00:03:17,379 --> 00:03:19,499
关于人类灵魂的形象。
what the human soul is like. 

70
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:25,620
我认为人类的灵魂就像野生动物。
I think the human soul is exactly like a wild animal.

71
00:03:25,620 --> 00:03:30,043
我们知道野生动物非常机智，
We know that wild animals are very resourceful,

72
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,200
适应能力很强,
they're very resilient,

73
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,613
很精明,
they're very savvy, 

74
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:36,550
他们知道如何在艰难的地方生存。
they know how to survive in tough places. 

75
00:03:36,550 --> 00:03:39,252
而所有这些都是人类灵魂的真实写照，
And all of that is true of the human soul, 

76
00:03:39,252 --> 00:03:42,155
如果不是这样的话，在任何一个房间
if it weren't true, there's a whole bunch of people 

77
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:44,360
都有一大堆人，如果他们没有这种足智多谋的精神
in any room who wouldn't be here today,

78
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,300
可以依靠的话，他们今天就不会在这里了。
if they hadn't had that resourcefulness to fall back on.

79
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,849
但也像野生动物一样，
But also like a wild animal,

80
00:03:50,849 --> 00:03:55,238
人类的灵魂本质上是害羞的。
the human soul is essentially shy. 

81
00:03:56,038 --> 00:03:59,549
我们知道，如果我们想看野生动物,
We know that if we want to see a wild animal,

82
00:03:59,549 --> 00:04:02,442
我们在这个世界上最不应该做的事情
the last thing in the world we should do 

83
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:05,020
就是冲进树林里大喊大叫，
is to go crashing into the woods screaming 

84
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,250
让其出来。
and yelling for the thing to come out.

85
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:09,560
我们可以在接下来的50年里这样做，
We can do that for the next 50 years 

86
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,500
但永远不会看到我们寻找的东西。
and never see the thing we seek.

87
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:15,129
我们也知道，如果我们
We also know that if we will walk

88
00:04:15,129 --> 00:04:16,823
悄悄地走进树林，
into the woods quietly, 

89
00:04:16,823 --> 00:04:19,799
坐在树根上,
sit at the base of a tree,

89
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:23,663
和大地一起呼吸一两个小时,
breathe with the earth for an hour or two,

90
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:27,210
也许我们要找的东西
it may well be that the thing we seek 

91
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:29,060
将会出现，
is going to put in an appearance,

92
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:32,769
那只野生动物会让自己了解到，
that wild animal will make itself known

93
00:04:32,769 --> 00:04:35,109
因为这个地方很安全。
because the space feels safe.

94
00:04:35,109 --> 00:04:37,210
我们至少会从眼角
And we will at least catch a glimpse 

95
00:04:37,210 --> 00:04:39,110
瞥到一瞥那灵魂，
out of the corner of our eye and

96
00:04:39,110 --> 00:04:44,019
我们一生都不会忘记那一瞥。
all our lives we will never forget that glimpse.

97
00:04:44,019 --> 00:04:47,721
在教学勇气团体中,
The courage to teach groups, 

98
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:52,193
我们为之工作的社区形式，
the form of community that we're working for there

99
00:04:52,193 --> 00:04:55,428
就像走进森林,
is exactly like walking into the woods,

100
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:59,210
彼此安静地坐在树根下，
sitting quietly at the base of the tree with each other

102
00:04:59,210 --> 00:05:03,289
等待灵魂出场的
and waiting for that precious moment

103
00:05:03,289 --> 00:05:05,339
那个珍贵时刻。
when the soul puts in an appearance. 

104
00:05:05,339 --> 00:05:10,119
当灵魂出现时，以完全和
And when it does, treating it with utter and

105
00:05:10,119 --> 00:05:15,149
无条件的尊重对待k，让k找到自己的声音。
unconditional respect and letting it find its own voice.
