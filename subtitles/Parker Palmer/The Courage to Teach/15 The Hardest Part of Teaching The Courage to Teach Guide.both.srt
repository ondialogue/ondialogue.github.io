1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,840
I think the hardest part about being a teacher 

2
00:00:07,840 --> 00:00:13,150
is to see the potential that is

3
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:14,860
in the young people you're working with.

4
00:00:14,860 --> 00:00:18,050
And to see all of the things that 

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,155
get in the way of them fulfilling that potential.

6
00:00:22,155 --> 00:00:24,791
I think the hardest part of being a teacher 

7
00:00:24,791 --> 00:00:31,400
is to look at human lives being sorted or wasted,

8
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,970
human lives being diminished.

9
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,240
Sometimes by what's going on in the community 

10
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,409
or by what's going on in the family,

11
00:00:40,409 --> 00:00:43,377
but also by what's going on in school.

12
00:00:44,377 --> 00:00:47,199
If you think for a while about these teachers

13
00:00:47,199 --> 00:00:50,217
who are now being told by every politician in the country,

15
00:00:50,217 --> 00:00:53,186
your job is to get these kids 

16
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:58,559
to pass this test at a higher score,

17
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,429
so that your job will be secure 

18
00:01:01,429 --> 00:01:04,200
and your school will get money. 

19
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,330
Well, I think we know the outcome of that.

20
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,109
The outcome is banality, 

20
00:01:08,109 --> 00:01:10,939
the outcome is trivialization of the work 

21
00:01:10,939 --> 00:01:13,870
and the outcome is the crushing of lives of kids.

22
00:01:13,870 --> 00:01:15,979
What our teachers going to do 

23
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:17,620
under those circumstances?

24
00:01:17,620 --> 00:01:19,046
They're going to spend a lot of time 

25
00:01:19,046 --> 00:01:20,981
getting the kids ready for the tests,

26
00:01:20,981 --> 00:01:23,290
not dealing with those issues

27
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,285
in the children's lives. 

28
00:01:25,585 --> 00:01:31,149
That wort their development that build barriers to

29
00:01:31,149 --> 00:01:33,079
their growth as human beings. 

30
00:01:33,579 --> 00:01:36,164
It takes a rare and courageous teacher 

31
00:01:36,164 --> 00:01:38,465
under those circumstances to say: 

32
00:01:38,465 --> 00:01:42,336
"No, no, I'm not going to teach to the test, 

33
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:46,940
I'm going to teach these children what they need to know,

34
00:01:46,940 --> 00:01:52,817
to be full human beings in a very difficult world".
