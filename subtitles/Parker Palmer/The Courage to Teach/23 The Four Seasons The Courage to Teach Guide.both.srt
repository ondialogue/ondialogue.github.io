1
00:00:04,910 --> 00:00:09,180
当我们决定在这个百花齐放的世俗社会
When we decided to take on inner life issues

2
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,449
背景下处理内在生命问题时，
in the context of this fleur allistic secular society,

3
00:00:13,449 --> 00:00:16,384
我们必须非常仔细地思考
we had to think very carefully about the metaphors

4
00:00:16,384 --> 00:00:19,039
我们想要用来邀请人们进入
that we wanted to use to invite people

5
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,009
本质上是灵性旅程的隐喻。
into what is essentially a spiritual journey.

7
00:00:22,009 --> 00:00:23,525
因为我们希望这些隐喻
Because we wanted those metaphors  

8
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,900
是开放和慷慨的，
to be open and generous,

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:29,760
尊重所有的传统，
respectful of all traditions and  

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,720
以及那些没有传统的人。
of people who have no tradition.  

11
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:35,970
但与此同时，这些隐喻会
But at the same time metaphors that 

12
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:39,580
会唤起我们对困难和充满希望的问题的注意。  
would call our attention to difficult and hopeful questions.   

13
00:00:39,580 --> 00:00:43,470
我感到非常幸运的是，
And I feel very blessed really in the fact 

14
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:45,239
我们偶然发现了季节性的隐喻，
that we sort of stumbled across the 

15
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:47,580
作为实现这一目标的方法，
seasonal metaphors as ways to do that 

16
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,409
它们为我们提供了非常好的服务。
and they have served us remarkably well. 

17
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:53,360
我们使用的主题是四季的主题,
The themes we use are the themes of the Four Seasons,

18
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:55,969
也就是四季的隐喻。
the metaphors of the Four Seasons. 

19
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,109
我们从秋天开始，基本主题
We start in the fall where the fundamental theme 

20
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:03,830
是真实自我的种子。
is the seed of true self.

21
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:07,670
秋天是大自然播种的季节。
The fall is when nature is planting her seeds.

22
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,910
因此，我们邀请人们思考，
And so we invite people to think about 

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,000
你出生时种下了什么种子,
what seed was planted when you were born,

25
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,270
你与生俱来的天赋是什么，
what are those birthright gifts, 

26
00:01:14,270 --> 00:01:18,600
你最初的自性是什么?
what is that original selfhood that you arrived with.

27
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,980
30、40、50年后的今天，你可能与之有一些距离。
now 30 40 50 years later you may be some distance from.

28
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,120
让我们回到过去，
Let's go back and 

29
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:26,630
并 试着回想并重拾那颗种子。
 try to recall and reclaim that seed. 

30
00:01:26,630 --> 00:01:33,230
当然，在冬天，这些种子会被埋起来，
In the winter of course those seeds are buried  

31
00:01:33,230 --> 00:01:36,010
感觉它们已经死了和消失了。
and it feels like they're dead and gone.

32
00:01:36,010 --> 00:01:40,120
但事实是，在冬天,
But the truth is that in winter,

33
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:42,270
地下有很多事情发生，
there's a lot happening underground

34
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:45,559
正在等待着重生的季节。
that is awaiting a season of rebirth.

35
00:01:45,559 --> 00:01:47,980
因此，我们在冬天问的问题
So the questions we ask in the winter

36
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:50,510
与死亡和垂死、
have to do with death and dying,

37
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:53,010
以及休眠和更新有关。
dormancy and renewal.   

38
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:57,030
这是一个令人着迷的内在生活问题，
And it's a fascinating inner life questioning that 

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:02:00,040
在我身上感觉死亡或垂死的东西，
which feels dead or dying in me is 

40
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,624
它实际上进入了一个休眠期，
it in fact going into a period of dormancy    

41
00:02:03,624 --> 00:02:06,330
等待重生的季节。
and awaiting a season of rebirth.  

42
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:09,239
教师们在面对
And teachers have found the most wonderful 

43
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:11,400
他们内心的休眠时
things in coming to terms with what is 

44
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,610
发现了最奇妙的事情，
dormant  inside of them,   

45
00:02:13,610 --> 00:02:16,030
奇妙的是他们现在能够
wonderful in the sense that they're now able to  

46
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:18,000
用全新的目光看待他们的学生，
look at their students through new eyes,

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,750
因为作为一个青少年，除了一群门卫。
because what is a teenager but a bundle of doormen sees.

48
00:02:22,350 --> 00:02:25,610
在春天，我们使用的
In the spring the theme  

49
00:02:25,610 --> 00:02:28,250
主题是悖论之花，
we uses the flowering of paradox

50
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:34,010
即在春天发生的事情是完全矛盾的，
that is what happens in spring is utterly paradoxical 

51
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:37,260
从那似乎冻结和死亡的东西中，
that out of that which seemed frozen and dead,

53
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,430
有新生命在涌现中。
there is this proliferation of new life.    

54
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:45,910
这非常... 但它本身就很矛盾,
And it's very... but itself is very paradoxical,

55
00:02:45,910 --> 00:02:48,390
因为在春天变得美丽之前，
because spring before it gets beautiful

56
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,570
到处充斥着丑陋的泥土和淤泥。
is just plug ugly it's mud and muck.

57
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:52,800
我们都试图让它远离
And we're all trying to keep it off   

58
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,790
我们的鞋子和房子，
our shoes and out of the houses, 

59
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,770
除了泥巴和淤泥
but the mud and the muck 

60
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,680
在美的产生过程中扮演着重要的作用。
have a role to play in the generation of beauty. 

61
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:02,600
这种幽默也是关于谦逊的。
It's that houmous which is also about humility.

62
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:06,620
那是花儿生长的土地。
That is the ground in which the flower grows.

63
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,740
到了夏天,
And then in the summer,  

64
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:14,630
我们谈到丰收和收获的季节，
we speak about the season of abundance and harvest,

65
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:16,670
所以现在的问题是，
so the question now becomes  

66
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:20,670
在我的生活中，
what is it that is growing abundantly in my life,

67
00:03:20,670 --> 00:03:24,480
在这个漫长的秋、冬、春的旅程中，
out of this long journey through fall, winter and spring,

68
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,753
有什么东西是丰收的和收获的，
that is meant to be harvested 

69
00:03:26,753 --> 00:03:29,230
是要为别人服务的。 
to serve to feed others.  

70
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,250
所以我们发现，
So we have we've discovered that  

71
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:34,210
这些季节性的主题和隐喻
these seasonal themes and metaphors  

72
00:03:34,210 --> 00:03:36,620
可以为许多不同传统的人
can create the most generous room  

73
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:38,860
和没有传统的人
for people of many different traditions and  

74
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:42,080
创造最慷慨的空间，
no tradition at all to deal with  

75
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:44,259
来处理内心生活的真正问题。
real issues of the inner life, 

76
00:03:44,259 --> 00:03:48,229
 以一种不冒犯他们
to do so in a language that doesn't  offend them  

77
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:51,300
或不排挤他们的语言来这样做，
or doesn't marginalize them and  

78
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:54,000
并最终允许他们进入这种语言,
eventually allows them to come into the language, 

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,270
对他们来说最有意义的语言。
their own language that has most meaning for them.

80
00:03:57,270 --> 00:04:00,420
这是一个非常神奇的方式，
It's a very amazing way 

81
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:03,890
可以浮现内心深处的人生课题，
to come out deep inner life issues 

82
00:04:03,890 --> 00:04:08,720
让人们专注于重要的事情。
keeping people focused on things that matter.

83
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:11,520
但与此同时，以一种每个人都觉得
And yet at the same time doing that in a way

84
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:14,200
在他们的特定传统中
that everyone feels honored

85
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:27,500
受到尊重的方式来做这件事。
by in their particular tradition.
