1
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,650
公立学校教师的
There's a very high degree of turnover 

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:09,370
流动率非常高。
among public school teachers.

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,049
因为生活条件是如此困难，
Because the conditions of life are  

4
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:15,250
坦率地说是如此令人心碎。
so difficult and  frankly so heartbreaking.

5
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:16,789
当你怀着一颗饱满的心
And one of the things that 

6
00:00:16,789 --> 00:00:19,653
进入一个行业时，就会发生这样的事情，
happens when you go into a profession with a full heart.

7
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:22,189
这也是进入教学领域的唯一原因。
And that's the only reason to go into teaching.

8
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:24,459
你进去不是为了变得富有和出名。
You don't go in to get rich and famous.

9
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:26,630
就是那些压迫性的环境
It's that those oppressive conditions

10
00:00:26,630 --> 00:00:28,029
会让你心碎。
then break your heart.

11
00:00:28,029 --> 00:00:30,899
如果你没有某种支持，
And it's very hard to bear that,

12
00:00:30,899 --> 00:00:33,240
就很难承受这种情况。
if you don't have some kind  of support.

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:36,200
在我看来，
It seems to me that there's 

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,050
当我们不能支持
a kind of madness in any institution to fail,

15
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,220
从事这项工作的人的心时，
when we fail to support the 

16
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,580
任何机构都会失败至极。  
hearts of the people doing the work.   

17
00:00:45,580 --> 00:00:49,783
而相反，让他们受制于外部标准，
And instead, subject them to external standards,

18
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:54,720
受制于惩罚，为完成工作而责备他们。
to punishments, berate them for a job for it done.

19
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:57,990
当然，我们都知道，在一些非常基本的层面上，
Surely, we all know at some very basic level 

20
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,762
为了发展我们所做的任何工作，
that to grow whatever work we doing,

21
00:01:01,762 --> 00:01:04,040
我们需要有人照顾，
we need to be tended the way 

22
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:05,869
就像园丁照料植物那样。
a gardener tends plants.

23
00:01:05,869 --> 00:01:09,110
而这正是我认为公立学校教师需要的。
And that's what I think public school teacher's need.

24
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:11,419
但他们没有得到这种照顾。
But are not getting.  

25
00:01:11,419 --> 00:01:14,719
相反，他们受到了斥责，
They are getting instead berated  

26
00:01:14,719 --> 00:01:17,689
他们被指责为有各种
and they are getting accused of all kinds of 

27
00:01:17,689 --> 00:01:19,850
不足之处和能力缺失。
inadequacies and in competencies.  

28
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,420
我们经常在报纸上看到这种情况。 
We read it in the newspapers all the time.  

29
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:25,360
结果很自然，人们放弃了，
And the result is very natural,  people bail out, 

30
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,259
他们寻找让他们更快乐、
they look for something that makes them happier,

31
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:29,630
更满意的东西。
that's more satisfying.  

32
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:35,160
但我不认为他们会高兴地退出,
But I don't think they bail out gladly,

34
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:37,200
我认为他们是悲哀地退出的，
I think they bail out sadly,   

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,734
我觉得他们一开始是去教书的,
I think they went into teaching in the first place, 

36
00:01:40,734 --> 00:01:44,779
因为他们喜欢孩子，喜欢学习生活。
because they love kids and they love the learning life.

37
00:01:44,779 --> 00:01:47,741
对他们中的许多人来说，这是一种悲哀，
And it's a grief for many of them,

38
00:01:47,741 --> 00:01:51,320
在他们希望或
that they have to come to the end of the road 

39
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,899
渴望这样做之前，
long before they had 

40
00:01:52,899 --> 00:01:55,610
他们不得不走到道路的尽头。
wished or desired to do so.
