00:00:06,135 --> 00:00:14,305
面对学生们让人头疼的行为和学习问题，
旧金山的一所公立中学决定
尝试一些完全不同的东西。
这是他们的故事。

大家结伴而行。
Okay, partner up everybody.

27
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:14,911
我叫凌布什， 
My name is Ling Busche, 

28
00:01:14,911 --> 00:01:17,744
是玛丽娜中学七年级的辅导员。
I'm a seventh grade counselor at Marina Middle School.

29
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,662
你得排到队伍最后。
You gotta go to the end of the line.

30
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,663
不错的尝试，德尚。
Nice try, Deshaun.

31
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,624
我们是规模较大的中学之一。
We're one of the larger middle schools.

32
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:26,795
我们的学生人数大约有九百。
We have a student population of about nine hundred.

34
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,963
今天排队很顺利。
Line is going pretty smooth today.

35
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,340
在学生人数方面，
There is a great divide

36
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,093
学校有很大的分化。
in terms of student population.

37
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,720
同学们，我们进去吧。
Guys, let's go inside.

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,139
我们已经有了荣誉班，
You've got the honors classes that

39
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,308
拥有表现最好的学生,
have the highest performing students,

40
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,643
他们没有行为方面的问题。
no behavior problems.

41
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,521
我们也有普通班，是个混合班级,
Then you have the general ed classes, which are a mix,

42
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,108
包括考试成绩最低的学生。
but contain students who have the lowest test scores.

43
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:55,949
我几乎没有收到荣誉班的行为转介报告。
I virtually get no behavioral referrals for the honors classes.

45
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:57,617
所有的学科转介
All of the disciplinary referrals 

46
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,619
都来自于普通教育班。
are coming out of the general ed classes.

48
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,503
我们确实有看起来服务很好的学生，
We do haves students who seem well-served,

49
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,173
他们很成功，表现很好，
who are successful, who perform well and

50
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:16,344
而在同一个校园里，我们有一群学生
within our very same campus, we have a group of students who

51
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,264
与大家是完全脱节和脱离的。
are completely disconnected and disengaged.

52
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,184
在我们的学生中，有相当多的人
There is a significant number of our students

52
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,894
{\an6}<font size="12px"> 安东尼·布拉克森<br/><br/>助理校长</font>

53
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,229
不认为学校是一个适合他们待的地方。
that don't see school as a place for them.

54
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,023
我总是说，“他们不上学”
I always say it by saying, "they don't do school."

55
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,858
迭戈。
Diego.

56
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,029
一个捣乱的孩子会破坏
One disruptive kid can take away any learning

57
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,573
课堂上发生的任何学习。
that goes on in the class.

59
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:41,453
因此，其他孩子想捣蛋，
So other kids wanna misbehave 

60
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:43,413
因为他们认为所有人都在捣蛋。
because they think everybody's misbehaving.

61
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,540
闭嘴，你这只蟋蟀。
Shut up, you cricket.

63
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,876
胖妈妈。
Fat mama.

64
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,297
哦。
Ooh.

65
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,717
当全班都疯了，都在扔铅笔时,
When the class is crazy, and throwing pencils,

66
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,969
它完全扰乱了我的注意力。
it messes up my concentration fully.

67
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,723
所以我就坐在椅子上什么都不做。
So the thing I do is I just sit in my chair and do nothing.

68
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,016
克里斯？
Chris?

69
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,893
转过身来学习。
Turn around, get on task.

70
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,062
我已经把更多的学生送出教室并停课了，
I have sent out and suspended from my classroom

71
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,315
这是我很长时间以来的第一次。
more students than I have in a long time.

72
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,649
你会给我惹麻烦的。
You're gonna get me in trouble.

73
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,153
我只是觉得这种行为完全是离经叛道，
I just find the behavior to be completely off the wall

73
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,279
{\an4}<font size="12px"> 汤姆 · 埃恩勒<br/><br/>七年级教师</font>

74
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,448
无法接受，不仅是对我，而且是对彼此。
and unacceptable, not just toward me, but toward each other.

75
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,577
很多孩子可能不会觉得
A lot of kids might not feel that

76
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,622
学校总是与他们息息相关。
school is always relevant to them.

77
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,542
学校是为特定类型的孩子设计的,
School is structured for a certain type of kid,

78
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,629
而他们可能不是那种类型的孩子。
and maybe they're not that type of kid.

79
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,465
这种情况达到了他们不觉得自己被听到的地步。
It reaches a point where they don't feel like they're heard.

80
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:42,096
十号到四十号，甚至...
Number ten to forty, even...

82
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,848
这是昨天的作业。
This was the assignment yesterday.

83
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,101
当你来到埃恩勒先生的课堂时,
When you visit Mister Ehnle's class,

84
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,270
感觉那里很混乱。
it feels very chaotic in there.

85
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,438
你们俩怎么了？
What is going on with you two?

86
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,273
拿出一张纸。
Get out a piece of paper.

87
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,107
科学。
Science.

88
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,985
科学。
Science.

89
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:59,614
有一种不停地娱乐的感觉，
There's sort of this sense of nonstop entertainment,

91
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:03,409
而课上发生的任何事情往往成为次要的。
and whatever's happening in the lesson often becomes secondary.

93
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,788
不要把两栖动物这个词拼错了。
Do not misspell the word amphibian.

94
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,622
总之,
Anyways,

95
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,458
我忘了我在说什么了。
I forgot what I was saying.

96
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,961
他们的参与是与
Their engagement is tied to

97
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,964
院子里发生的事情、
the drama that's happening in the yard,

98
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,924
脸书上发生的事情联系在一起的，
what's happening on Facebook,

99
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:20,426
他们被这些事情所吸引，
and they are consumed by it 

100
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,638
所以在课堂上继续进行。
and so it just continues on in the classroom.

101
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,310
别踢我。
Stop kicking me.

102
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,064
你看到这头该死的鲸鱼刚刚做了什么吗？
Did you see what this freaking whale just did?

104
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,530
那是你的背包吗？
That's your backpack?

105
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,322
是的。
Yep.

106
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,240
你说什么？
Excuse me?

107
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,533
这是我的背包。
It's my backpack.

108
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,910
那是康纳的背包。
That's Connor's backpack.

109
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,995
珍妮特。
Jeanette.

110
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,458
珍妮特，离开教室!
Jeanette, leave the room.

111
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,419
我会和埃德温一起回去。
I'd go back out with Edwin.

112
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,004
坡度是M。
Slope is M.

113
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,423
我们取 Y 值。
We're going to take a Y value.

114
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,591
他在公交车上经常和蒂亚拉在一起，
He be hanging out with Tiara a lot on the bus, 

115
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,719
总是和她坐在一起。
he always be sitting with her.

116
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,679
我知道，但他们闹掰了。
I know, but they broke up.

117
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,514
她和他闹掰了。
Well, she broke up with him.

118
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:09,600
对不起，如果我还是听到你们接头接耳，
Excuse me, if I continue to hear talking, 

119
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,020
我就要给你们中一个或者两个换位子了。
one or both of you are gonna find a new seat.

121
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,146
呃。
Ugh.

122
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,856
不，不是“呃”。
No, that's not ugh.

123
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,899
而是，“是的， 埃德温先生”，然后续学习。
It's yes, Mister Ehnle, then you get on task.

124
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,361
教室里有那么多学生,
With that many bodies in a classroom,

125
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,530
当有人需要被转移到角落时,
when somebody needs to be moved off to a corner,

126
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,199
已经没有角落了，因为那里已经有人了。
there are no corners, 'cause there's already somebody there.

127
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,034
我已经放弃了。
I've given up.

128
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,452
我只是让他们坐到一起。
I just put 'em next to each other.

129
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,078
因为我宁愿让他们在彼此旁边说话、
'Cause I'd rather have them talking and yelling and

130
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,748
大喊大叫，而不是在教室里走来走去。
carrying on next to each other than across the room.

131
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,708
好好想想。
Think about it.

132
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,751
最近...
Lately...

133
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:38,920
如果没有人在接头接耳或分心，
We would all learn much more if nobody really 

134
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,341
我们都会学得更多。
was talking or getting distracted.

135
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,218
我们都想提高成绩,
We would all, like, have our grades up,

136
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,929
我们都会是好孩子。
we would all be good kids and everything.

137
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,182
我知道我们是好孩子，都很聪明,
I know we're good kids, we're smart,

138
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:53,394
但有时候，我想我们太懒了，没有表现出来。
but sometimes, I guess we're too lazy to show it.

140
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,647
好的，你们有一分钟的时间来完成你的拼写，
Okay, you have one minute to finish your spelling

141
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,066
然后你们要拿出一本紫色的书，
and then you need to get a purple book

142
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,525
就摆在你们面前。
that's right in front of you.

143
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,945
你这个蠢货。
You stupid bitch.

144
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,823
这就是为什么没人喜欢你的丑屁股。
That's why nobody likes your ugly ass.

145
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,408
没人喜欢你。
No one likes you.

146
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,577
杰拉尔多，继续拼写。
Gerardo, keep going, you're doing it.

147
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,413
杰拉多有时会发火，
Gerardo does get angry sometimes

148
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,917
挑衅老师。
and seek out a challenge with his teachers.

149
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,463
他基本上只出现在课堂上，
He basically shows up and

150
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,590
而很少做作业。
produces very little work.

151
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,343
这确实让他的学习
It has really brought him down

152
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,969
成绩下降了。
in terms of his academic performance.

153
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,513
我不是唯一一个胡闹的人。
I'm not the only one that fools around.

154
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,138
是的，你是。
Yeah you are.

155
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,056
不，我不是。
No, I'm not.

156
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,267
闭嘴，我们会得到他妈的零分的。
Shut up, we're gonna get fucking zeroes.

157
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,521
如果我感到沮丧，就会躁动不安，然后,
If I get frustrated, I get hot and then after,

158
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,315
觉得死气沉沉，所有能量消失了。
I get cold, all the heat goes away.

159
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,858
我刚做完嘞所有的作业。
I just finished all my work.

160
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,111
我感觉不太好。
It's not a good feeling that I have.

161
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,072
你能不能不要在我的作业上写字？
Could you stop writing on my work?

162
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,781
好吗？
Please?

163
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:50,034
中学男生很难长时间
Middle school boys have trouble sitting still 

164
00:06:50,034 --> 00:06:55,164
坐着不动，在课桌前集中注意力。
for long periods of time and focusing at their desks.

166
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,291
一般来说这对他们不起作用,
This really doesn't work for them in general,

167
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,459
但这就是学校的情况。
but that's the way school looks.

168
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,002
这是学校的结构使然。
That's how it's structured.

169
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,672
请把书翻到第十五课。
Open your books, please, to lesson 15.

170
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,757
第一个词，是什么词？
First word, what word?

171
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,134
我已经读了。
I already did it.

172
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,051
奥马尔？
Omar?

173
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,220
奥马尔，当老师说读第一个单词的时候，
Omar, when the teacher says read the first word,

174
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,054
你就得这么做。
that's what you do.

175
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,472
我读了第一个单词。
I read the first word.

176
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,390
准备好了。
On cue.

177
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,143
埃恩勒先生的班级就像一个丛林。
Mister Ehnle's class is a jungle.

178
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,688
每天都有人被送出去。
Everyday somebody gets sent out.

179
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:22,316
教室里面总是很疯狂，每个人都离开了座位，到处乱跑。
Always it's wild in there, everybody's out of their seat, just around.

181
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,737
这让我很难集中注意力，因为我会分心。
It makes it hard for me to focus 'cause I get distracted.

182
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,072
这让我很难学习。
It makes it hard to learn.

183
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,073
我们重新学一遍。
So let's reconvene.

184
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:29,782
马利克？
Malik?

185
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,242
坐到杰奎琳旁边去。
Go sit over there by Jacqueline.

186
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,326
不。
No.

187
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,621
我真为这些不上进的
I really fear for these kids who

188
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,165
孩子们感到担心。
don't put forth the effort.

189
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,166
他们不努力。
They don't try.

190
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,001
他们没有坚持不懈。
They don't persevere.

191
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,835
下一个词。
Next word.

192
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,421
下一个词，怎么发音呢？
Next word, what sound?

193
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,255
什么单词？
What word?

194
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,132
很好，下一个词。
Good, next word.

195
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,008
怎么发音？
What sound?

196
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,135
如果你没有学会坚持，
How can you put together a relationship,

197
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,680
你怎么能投入到一段关系中，
how can you stay at a job when it's not fun

198
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,183
工作若无趣，你怎么还能干下去？
if you have not learned to persevere?

199
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,934
你到底怎么了？
What is it that you?

200
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,935
我看不进书。
I'm not reading.

201
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,980
你这样的行为是
You're not gonna help yourself be successful

202
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,690
不会帮助自己成功的。
when you're behaving like this.

203
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,817
奥马尔？
Omar?

204
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,860
什么？
What?

205
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,612
这不是帮助自己成功的方法。
This is not the way to help yourself be successful.

206
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,113
我确实喜欢学新东西,
I do like learning new stuff,

207
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:12,366
但如果老师们用一种我不理解的困难方式来教学，
but if they're teaching it in a difficult way that I don't understand, 

208
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:14,577
那么我就不再努力了。
then I'm just gonna stop trying.

209
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,411
你知道吗？
You know what?

210
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,746
我不想听到任何争吵。
I don't wanna hear any arguing.

211
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,623
我知道我可以做得更好。
I know I could do better.

212
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,541
如果我只是交了作业。
If I just turned in my homework.

213
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,794
今晚的科学作业是十二点三分。
Tonight's homework for science is twelve dash three.

215
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,006
杰奎琳，坐到后面去。
Jacqueline, go sit in the back.

216
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:27,423
呃。
Ugh.

217
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,051
不，不要咂嘴，坐到后面去。
No, it's not smacking your lips, it's go sit in the back.

218
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,929
埃恩勒先生确实不尊重我。
Mister Ehnle does disrespect me.

219
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,765
他头上有个岛。
He has an island on his head.

220
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,142
穿得很奇怪。
He dresses weird.

221
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:41,395
戴着一副大眼镜。
He has huge glasses.

223
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,940
经常尖叫。
And he screams a lot.

224
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,149
不，你坐到杰拉尔多旁边。
No, you're next to Gerardo.

225
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,276
不，我坐到莱斯利旁边。
No, I'm next to Lesly.

226
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,570
你不仅在浪费自己的时间，
You're wasting not only your time,

227
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,657
可悲的是你在浪费别人的时间。
the sad part is you're wasting others' time.

228
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,325
我想知道这句话是什么。
I wanna know what the text is.

229
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,079
你打算什么时候再来一次？
When are you gonna have it again?

230
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,414
杰奎琳，如果你还在说话的话,
Jacqueline, if you are having a conversation,

231
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,167
要么结束它，要么到教室外去。
it will end or you will be out of the classroom.

232
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,253
你为什么总是把我赶出教室？
Why do you always send me out of the classroom?

233
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:05,920
啊？
Huh?

234
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,256
因为你话太多了。
Because you do so much talking.

235
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,633
他以为我总是
He's assuming that I'm always

236
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,134
那个挑起问题的人。
the one that's starting the problems.

237
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,427
这让我很生气。
It makes me feel mad.

238
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:17,056
杰奎琳，拿上你的东西，去见尼克。
Jacqueline, get your stuff and go see Nick.

240
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:23,020
当老师们在课堂上尝试了一些东西后，
When the teachers have tried things in the classroom, 

241
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:26,190
学生就会被转诊。
then the student comes down with the referral.

243
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,071
当我们被赶出教室时,
When we get kicked out,

244
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,781
我们去学校办公室。
we go down to the office.

245
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,827
我总是被他赶出去的那个人。
I'm always the one that he sends out.

246
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,120
这感觉总是很糟。
It always feels bad.

247
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,584
有时，他们会因为以前的
Sometimes, they get pigeonholed because of,

248
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,877
行为模式而被归类。
you know, previous patterns of behavior.

249
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:51,465
我认为他们都觉得自己是弱者。
I think that they all feel like the underdogs.

251
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,050
没人支持他们。
No one's rooting for them.

253
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,733
杰拉尔多，当你被赶出去时,
Gerardo, when you get sent down,

254
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,652
十有八九是因为一些看起来
nine times out of ten it's because of something like,

255
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,321
很小的事情，比如说与人争吵。
which seems small, like an argument.

256
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,448
她好像觉得我以前做过这种事情，
She's like you have a history of doing stuff

257
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,742
我说，但我不会再做我以前的旧习了,
and I said but I'm not doing what I used to back,

258
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,036
这是六年级时的事情了
back in sixth grade or nothing.

259
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,164
进出办公室的学生很多,
A lot of the students that come in and out of the office,

260
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,335
讽刺的是，有时候感觉他们
ironically, sometimes it feels like they

261
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,837
想来咨询办公室,
want to come to the counseling office,

262
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:31,573
这有点进退两难，
which is a little bit of a dilemma 

263
00:10:31,573 --> 00:10:34,675
因为他们在教室外的时间更多。
because they're outside of the classroom more.

264
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,469
而这，有点，不公平。
And it's, like, not fair.

265
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:37,946
如果这一切都归结到它，
If it all boils down to it, 

266
00:10:37,946 --> 00:10:39,930
你搞砸了自己，因为...
you're messing yourself up, because...

267
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,349
但如果我什么都没做,
But if I'm not doing nothing,

268
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,933
我怎么搞砸了？
how am I messing myself up?

269
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,851
我怎么会，我怎么会，
How am I, how am I,

270
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,228
我不是什么都不做，
how am I the one that's putting myself into this

271
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,271
怎么会是我把自己扯进来的呢？
when I'm not doing nothing?

272
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,481
你要错过考试了,
You're missing your test,

273
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,859
现在让你补上那个测验，
so now it's gonna be kind of a hassle to get you

274
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,235
会有点麻烦的。
to make up that test.

275
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,612
集腋成裘。
It all adds up.

276
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,280
但我什么都没做。
But I didn't do anything.

277
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,822
没做什么？！
Nothing?！

278
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,531
什么都没做。
Nothing.

279
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,366
当你站在全班
When you're in the moment

280
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:01,369
同学面前的那一刻，事情就升温，
and you're in front of the class, things get heated,

282
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,496
他们就会...，问题就会升级。
they become, you know, the problem becomes escalated.

283
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,539
我想让我妈妈过来跟那位女士讲讲道理。
I want my mom to come and talk some sense into that lady.

284
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,957
好吧，她也可以参与其中。
Okay, well she can be part of that, too.

285
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,292
我发誓，她只是...
I swear, she just...

286
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:11,003
我们最近来了一位顾问，
We have a consultant that came in recently, 

288
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:14,632
她居然把我们的学校说成是种族隔离的地方，
and she actually described our school as apartheid-land,

289
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:17,886
起初我有点反感，
which, I was at first a little bit offended by,

290
00:11:17,886 --> 00:11:22,515
但想了想，我明白她的意思。
but after thinking about it, I understood what she meant.

291
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:25,397
因为她看到咨询办公室
Because she saw who was coming 

292
00:11:25,397 --> 00:11:28,396
里进进出出的学生。
in and out of the counseling office.

293
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,940
我不想看到你今天带着另一个推介来这里,
I don't want to see you in here with another referral today,

294
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:31,649
杰拉尔多.
Gerardo.

295
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,191
好吧。
Alright.

296
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:32,900
振作起来。
Get it together.

297
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:34,985
拉丁裔和非裔美国孩子
It's our Latino and African American kids 

297
00:11:34,985 --> 00:11:36,445
成绩不好，
who are underachieving, 

298
00:11:36,445 --> 00:11:39,198
他们不觉得自己是学校的一份子，
who don't feel like they're part of the school and

300
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:40,376
我们必须解决这个问题，
we have to address that, 

301
00:11:40,376 --> 00:11:43,162
我们必须让那些孩子成为学校的一部分，
we have to make those kids part of the school and 

302
00:11:43,162 --> 00:11:46,036
我们必须给那些学生机会，
we have to allow those students the opportunities and, 

303
00:11:46,036 --> 00:11:48,416
实际上，让他们可以更上层楼。
in fact, get them to achieve at a higher level.

304
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,501
嘿，克里斯，你为什么不来我的办公室，
Hey, Chris, why don't you just come into my office

305
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,920
我来帮你清理那张小桌子吧？
and I'm gonna clear off that little table for you?

306
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,250
一些让所有孩子受益的事情
Something that would benefit all of the kids 

307
00:11:57,250 --> 00:12:00,803
必须发生在所有的学生身上。
had to happen across all of the students.

309
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,931
所以当我们的一个治疗师
So when one of our therapists talked about the idea

310
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,058
谈到进入教室教授
of going into the classroom to teach

311
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:10,730
冥想策略以减少冲突、
meditative strategies which would reduce conflict,

313
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,275
集中注意力的想法时，我们就说，真是太棒了。
increase focus, you know, we were like, that's perfect.

314
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,278
莫伊塞斯？
Moises?

315
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,112
在。
Yes.

316
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,405
你怎么没去上课，伙计？
Why are you out of class, buddy?

317
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,365
我去买东西了。
I went to get groceries.

318
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:23,733
我们的停课率比这个城市的
We are suspending at a rate higher than 

320
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:25,661
任何一所中学都要高。
any other middle school in this city.

321
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,247
我知道不能再这样下去了。
And I know that that has to stop.

323
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,586
我们想要做的是创造一种
What we'd like to do is create a sense of

324
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,672
这里是个社区的感觉，我们不会把人们赶出去的。
this is a community, and we're not just gonna push you out.

325
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,967
我们会帮助教你如何做，并做得很好。
We're gonna help teach you about how to do this and do it well.

327
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,303
所以我们要看看你在这个过程中的进展,
So we're gonna look and see where you are at in the process,

328
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,638
你经历过多少次这种事了。
how many times this has happened with you.

329
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,848
只发生过一次。
It's only happened once.

330
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,309
不过她说六年级的时候发生了意外。
She says there was a sixth grade incident, though, so.

331
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,853
我们之所以支持
So one of the reasons that we embraced bringing in

332
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:52,986
将正念引进课堂的原因之一是，
mindfulness into the classroom was to say 

333
00:12:52,986 --> 00:12:55,737
如果我们能在社区内创造一盏明灯，
a bright light within the community, 

334
00:12:55,737 --> 00:12:58,277
让成人和孩子们看到它们，
where adults and children can see that, 

334
00:12:58,277 --> 00:13:00,237
“嘿，有些东西真的在努力
hey, something is really working

335
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:04,658
让这个社区更具包容性，而且对每个人来说,
to make this community more inclusive and for everybody,

336
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:07,536
如果我们能开始在玛丽娜中学周围创造这个部分，
if we can start creating those spots around Marina Middle School, 

337
00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:10,664
那么其他人会看到它，并开始采取
then others will see it and start to adopt that

339
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,000
这种同理心和态度，说该学校
empathetic and that attitude of saying that the school

340
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,169
能满足更多的这些需求。
is gonna meet more of those needs.

342
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,012
我叫梅根·考恩，
My name is Megan Cowan,

343
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:30,059
来自一个叫正念学校的组织。
and I am here from an organization called Mindful Schools.

344
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,644
我们走进教室，
We go into classrooms

345
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,522
教授一种叫正念的东西。
and teach something called mindfulness.

346
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:37,772
我每周会去你们的教室两次，
I'm gonna be visiting your classroom twice a week 

347
00:13:37,772 --> 00:13:41,195
每次大概20或30分钟，
for just 20, maybe 30 minutes

349
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,198
我们在正念中要做的事情之一,
and one of the things that we'll be doing in mindfulness,

350
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,908
会有点不寻常,
which is gonna be a little bit unusual,

351
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,327
我想对你们中的一些人来说很奇怪，
and I think weird for some of you, is we're gonna,

352
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,497
我们会有一段时间是完全静默的。
there are gonna be periods of time that are totally silent.

353
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,375
那又怎样，我们要冥想吗？
So what, are we gonna be meditating?

354
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,253
如果你们有问题，请举手。
So let's raise your hand if you wanna have a question.

355
00:13:57,253 --> 00:13:59,090
最大的误解是，
The biggest misconception is that 

356
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:01,674
认为正念是灵性的或宗教的。
mindfulness is spiritual or religious.

357
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,468
虽然正念可以追溯到
Although it can be traced back to

357
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:06,668
{\an6}<font size="12px">梅根 · 库恩<br/><br/>正念导师</font></font>

358
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,720
非常传统的做法,
very traditional practices,

359
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:11,141
但它可以用世俗的方式来解决当今社会的问题。
it can be used in a secular way to address issues in society today.

361
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:13,185
我们现在要尝试的是
What we're gonna try right now is

361
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,604
我称之为正念的姿势。
just what I call mindful posture.

363
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:17,182
如果你们无精打采或者身体倾斜，
If you're slouching or leaning,

364
00:14:17,182 --> 00:14:19,859
就暂时离开你们的椅子，
just lift off your chair momentarily for a few,

365
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,319
我们大概要做两分钟。
we're gonna do this for about two minutes, maybe.

366
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,615
请大家举起手，
And take your hands and 

367
00:14:26,615 --> 00:14:30,995
把它们放在桌上或腿上。
decide to put them either on your desk or in your lap.

368
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,746
你是说把手放在桌子上吗？
You said put them on your desk?

369
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,373
你也可以放在腿上。
Or in your lap.

370
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,377
然后注意你的身体是否有什么东西在动，
And then notice if anything in your body is moving,

371
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,964
比如你的腿在跳或者你的脚在动,
like if your leg is bouncing or your foot's moving,

372
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,841
或者你的手指在动。
or your fingers are moving.

373
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,136
我认为正念是一种工具或技能。
I think of mindfulness as a tool or a skill.

374
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:52,186
我们的社会和文化正在训练我们不要专注，
Society and our culture is training us to not be focused, 

376
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:54,727
科技正在使我们一直不断地
so technology is causing us to jump from

377
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,896
从一件事跳转到另一件事上。
one thing to the next constantly, all the time.

378
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,523
当我们被要求或需要专注于某事时,
And when we're asked or required to focus on something,

379
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,901
我们的大脑实际上并没有准备好这样做。
our brain, actually, is not prepared to do that.

380
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,319
它没受过这方面的训练。
It's not trained to do that.

381
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,195
我认为在一个非常实用的层面上,
So I think on a very practical level,

382
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,948
正念在我们的生活创造了更多的聚焦点，
it's just creating more focus in our lives

383
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,493
并尽可能让一切变得宁静。
and try to let everything become still.

384
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,328
呃。
Ugh.

385
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,123
大家注意，这样很不舒服。
And notice that this is uncomfortable.

386
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,375
不过不是不舒服。
It's not uncomfortable.

388
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,085
如果你觉得有必要谈谈。
And if you feel the need to talk.

389
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:23,422
它真正教的是增加冲动控制，
It really teaches about increasing impulse control

391
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,383
这样我们在行动上就有了更多的选择。
so that we get more choice around our actions.

392
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,344
好了，现在放松。
Okay, now relax.

393
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,137
注意听我说。
Keep your attention with me.

395
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,558
我感觉糟透了。
I feel horrible.

397
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,357
是啊，告诉我你为什么不喜欢。
Yeah, tell me why you didn't like it.

398
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,275
感觉还不错。
It was like, it was alright.

399
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,486
后来，我感觉不到自己的身体，
Then later, I couldn't feel my body and

400
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,404
我的腿感觉有点怪怪的，
it felt kinda weird on my legs, so,

401
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,323
就像我中枪了或什么的，我不知道。
like if I got shot or something, I don't know.

402
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,325
大家可否往我这里看？
Can I have everybody's eyes up here?

403
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,242
谢谢你们。
Thank you.

404
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,202
克里斯？
Chris?

405
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,328
什么事，夫人？
Yes, ma'am?

407
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,664
在我离开之前,
Before I leave,

408
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,167
在我离开之前，我想告诉你们
before I leave, I wanna tell you guys about

409
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,170
正念背后的科学。
the science behind mindfulness.

410
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,383
科学表明，正念实际上会影响我们的大脑。
Science shows that mindfulness actually affects our brain.

411
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,510
当我们进行正念时,
And when we use mindfulness,

413
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,720
你们知道会发生什么吗？
you know what, you guys?

414
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,931
我们必须想出一些办法来让正念发挥作用，
We're gonna have to figure out some way to make this work

415
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,308
因为我要来15次。
since I'm gonna be here 15 times.

416
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,352
15次？
15 times?

417
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,646
我确实发现自己期望
I did find myself having expectations that I

418
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,607
在他们选择故意捣乱或在我离场
deserved some more time before they would choose to be

419
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,652
签出之前有更多的时间教授正念，
deliberately disruptive or before you check out,

420
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,196
但我认为冷漠是青少年的一部分,
but I think apathy is part of being a teenager,

421
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,365
所以我一点也不惊讶。
so I wasn't surprised.

422
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,076
所以我想问的是，
So what I wanna ask is that

423
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,496
在课堂上保持一定程度的注意力，
there's a certain level of attention in the class

424
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:41,750
表明你至少愿意听一会儿。
that shows that you are at least willing to listen for a while.

426
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,835
克里斯？
Chris?

427
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,087
如果你想要这种程度的注意力，
So, if you want this level of attention,

428
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,880
你得让事情变得有趣，
you gotta make stuff entertaining

429
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,924
因为这里的孩子都很好动。
'cause kids over here are hyperactive.

430
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:51,635
正念实际上是
Mindfulness actually is 

432
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,555
训练你在不被外物娱乐的
training you to be comfortable

433
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,016
时候感到舒适自在。
when you're not being entertained.

434
00:16:57,016 --> 00:16:58,687
因为在你的一生中，
'Cause you will not be entertained 

435
00:16:58,687 --> 00:17:01,353
你不会一天24小时都得到娱乐。
24 hours a day of your whole life.

436
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,688
等一下。
Hang on.

437
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,442
梅根进来的时候，我想，哦，伙计，
When Megan came in, I thought, oh man,

438
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,988
我们这么糟糕，他们还要把我们拍成电视节目？
we're that bad they gotta bring a T.V. show about us?

439
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,534
我不知道我们班是怎么被选中的，
I'm not sure how our class was chosen,

440
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,744
但是...
but...

441
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:21,622
孩子们问为什么要把正念课程带到他们的教室，
The kids ask why mindfulness was brought to their classrooms 

442
00:17:21,622 --> 00:17:23,713
因为其他教室并没有提供正念课程，
because it's not being offered in other classrooms, 

443
00:17:23,713 --> 00:17:25,252
我想他们知道其原因为何。
and I think they know the reason why.

444
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:29,256
一般来说，这个课程有时候会让人有点抓狂。
Generally, that the classes are a little bit crazy at times.

445
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:34,887
当他们如此习惯于走另一条路，
It's hard to go down that road when they're so used to

446
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,638
即混乱和无序的路时，
going down the other road

447
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,808
很难走有序这条路。
which is a road of chaos and disorder.

449
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,488
如果他们合作,
If they cooperate,

450
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,867
而且他们，如果留心的话，他们会改变，但是，
and they, like, pay attention, they would change but

451
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,453
不过我知道有些孩子不会合作,
because I know some of the kids won't,

452
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,040
我不知道这个班的情况。
I don't know about the class.

454
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,085
他们进去了吗？
Did they get in?

455
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,835
他们进去了吗？
Did they get in?

456
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,544
他们进去了吗？
Did they get in?

457
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,587
莱斯利,
Lesly,

458
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,923
她上课不认真听讲。
she doesn't pay attention in class.

459
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,636
她没有完成她应该做的家庭作业。
She doesn't do homework like she should.

460
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,430
这不是我的错。
It's not my fault.

461
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,975
因为你没告诉我作业在哪儿！
because you didn't tell me where it is!

462
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,645
以前，她总是注意听讲，
Before, she always paid attention,

463
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,438
上交作业，
turned in her work

464
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,817
老师们从不抱怨。
the teachers never complained.

465
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,072
并不是我所有的家人
Not all of my family members

466
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,534
都完成了初中和高中的学业,
got to finish middle school and high school,

467
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,329
我想向他们证明，我可以做
and I want to show them that I can do

468
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,083
他们已做过的事情，我想向他们证明，
what they could have done, and I want to prove to them that

469
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,002
我可以去上大学，让他们看看，
I can go to college and show them that

470
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,548
我找到了一份好工作，并改变了我的生活。
I'm getting a good career and changing my life.

471
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,636
我们要祈祷。
We're going to pray.

472
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,515
我们总是和她说话。
We always talk to her.

473
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:07,396
尽量不要在课堂上说话。
So, try to limit conversation in class.

474
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:17,865
课堂是为了学习，大家要注意听讲，
The class is for studying, paying attention,

475
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,493
友谊是留给你离开学校的时候的。
friendships are for when you leave school.

476
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:28,500
我告诉你该做什么，你却不听。
I tell you the things you should do, but you don't listen.

477
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,880
我去教堂，祈祷你能打开心扉，
I go to church and pray for you to open your mind

478
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,049
在学校表现好，做正确的事，
do good in school, do things right

479
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,426
不要做坏事。
for you not to do bad things.

480
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,553
当我看到她情况不好，
When I see that she's not doing well

481
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,054
我告诉她这里没有电话,
I tell her there's no telephone,

482
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,764
没有电视，
there's no television

483
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,435
不能购物，去不了商店，
there's no shopping, going to the stores

484
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,605
或者如果你想要什么，我会告诉她什么都没有，
or if you want something, I tell her there's nothing

485
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,440
因为如果你表现糟糕，
because if you don't behave

486
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,275
我不会给你奖品的。
I'm not going to give you a prize.

487
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,278
如果你不付出努力，
If you don't put forth effort

488
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,198
谁来养活你，让你活下去？
who is going to give you a living so you can live?

489
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,825
没人，对吧？
Nobody, right?

490
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,705
有时候我告诉她，你拥有
Sometimes I tell her, you've got everything

491
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,249
像我这样的人在自己的国家所没有的一切。
that a person like me doesn't have in their own country.

492
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,251
而你却不知道如何利用这一点。
And you don't know how to take advantage of it.

493
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:14,214
这让我很难过。
That makes me sad. 

493
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:15,714
对我来说，作为一个母亲，
For me, as a mother

494
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,592
这是最悲哀的事情，这么多年轻人
that's the saddest thing, that so many young

495
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,511
是拉丁裔父母的孩子，
people that are the children of Latino parents

496
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,263
他们在这个国家出生，
kids who've been born in this country

497
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,098
却没有完成学业。
and they don't finish school.

499
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,456
当钵声完全消失的时候,
When the sound of the bell is completely gone for you,

500
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,791
请大家举手。
raise your hand.

501
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,713
当梅根第一次来到这个班级时，
When Megan first came to the class,

502
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,299
我们真的不知道发生了什么。
we really didn't know what was going on.

503
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,264
我们通常很吵，在房间里大喊大叫，
We're usually loud and we yell across the room and

504
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,224
我们会从座位上站起来,
we just get up from our seats and like,

505
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,809
开开玩笑什么的。
crack jokes and stuff.

506
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,146
当她来到教室时，我们只是不想在课堂上
We were just trying not to be our normal selves in class

507
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,984
做正常的自己，但是有点困难。
when she came in, but it was kinda hard.

508
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,652
你能转过来吗？
Can you turn this way?

509
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,861
把你的椅子转过来，
Just go ahead and turn your whole chair

510
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,029
面朝前面。
and face that way.

511
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,450
再往前挪挪，
And go ahead and scoot up like,

512
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,576
一英尺半左右。
a foot and a half.

513
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,622
谢谢，要面朝前面。
Thanks, but facing that way.

514
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,542
把椅子转过来，
Like, just turn your chair

515
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,544
这样你正面朝向前面。
so you're exactly facing that way.

516
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,044
谢谢。
Thanks.

517
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,087
我是面朝那边的。
I am facing that way.

518
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,214
好的，但你明白我为什么这么问吗？
Okay, but do you understand why I'm asking?

519
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,340
是的。
Yes.

520
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,174
谢谢你。
Thank you.

521
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,178
请大家把手放在肚子上，
So put your hand on your belly

522
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,682
每个人都深呼吸一次，
and everybody take one deep breath

523
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,225
只有你自己能听见。
that only you can hear.

524
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,730
我们再试一次。
Let's try it again.

525
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:57,899
现在,
And now,

526
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,235
请做五次轻柔呼吸,
take five gentle breaths,

528
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,946
注意在腹部是否有感觉。
noticing if you feel it in your belly.

529
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,534
大家把手放在肚子上，这给了你另一种
You have your hand on your belly, it gives you another

530
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,037
感受自己真正在呼吸的方式。
way to feel that you actually are breathing.

531
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,331
呼吸对我们的情绪是有反应的,
Our breathing is responsive to our emotions,

532
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,042
所以这是一个与你的经验保持联结的好方法,
so it's a nice way to stay connected with your experience,

533
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,878
那就是观察或注意你的呼吸。
is to be watching or noticing your breathing.

534
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:19,670
接着我们做三次呼吸，
And then take three breaths, 

535
00:22:19,670 --> 00:22:22,049
注意你是否在胸部感觉到它。
noticing if you feel it in your chest.

536
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,970
梅根刚来
When Megan first came

537
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,680
教第一堂正念课时，
to teach the first mindfulness class,

538
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,349
我想离开教室。
I was like get outta here.

539
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,684
我不想做正念练习，你知道吗？
I don't wanna do this, you know?

540
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,062
我一开始也想表现得像个好孩子,
I was trying to look like a good kid in the beginning, too,

541
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,106
不过扔铅笔什么的也挺有意思的。
but then it was fun throwing pencils and stuff, you know.

542
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,025
不听老师的话总是很有趣,
Not listening to teachers is always fun,

543
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,610
但我知道这不是该做的事。
but it's not the thing to do.

544
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,153
我们要做一个挑战，
We're gonna do a challenge,

545
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:47,240
这个挑战就是正念呼吸一分钟。
and the challenge is to do mindful breathing for a minute.

546
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,077
每个人都要保持正念的姿势。
So everybody in your mindful posture.

548
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,205
什么？
What?

549
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:53,580
椅子。
Chair.

550
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,414
不，不，不，不，不，不。
No, no, no, no, no, no.

551
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,082
不是“不”。
It's not no.

552
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,416
不，不，不，不，不。
No, no, no, no, no.

553
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,250
我不想过去。
I don't want to go over there.

554
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,418
我没问你想不想。
I didn't ask if you wanted to.

555
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,170
是的，你说了。
Yes, you did.

556
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,089
我知道有些事让你分心了,
So, I know there's some distraction,

557
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,715
但我们还是要继续。
but we're just gonna continue.

558
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:09,346
从现在开始，我们要做一分钟的正念呼吸。
We're gonna do a minute of mindful breathing starting now.

560
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,558
克里斯，你能把手放进去吗？
Chris, can you put your hand in?

561
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,601
我要走过去。
I'm gonna walk by.

562
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,937
克里斯？
Chris?

564
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,106
谢谢你。
Thank you.

565
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,570
对于你们中的一些人来说，
For some of you, there was something about that experience

566
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:28,156
这种经历可让人感到愉快或者正面。
that may have felt pleasant, or positive.

568
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:29,991
嘿，伙计们？
Hey, guys?

569
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,284
你叫什么来着？
What's your name again?

570
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,619
拉斯蒂·沙克尔福德。
Rusty Shackleford.

571
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,746
马特 · 拉斯蒂 · 沙克尔福德,
So Matt Rusty Shackleford,

573
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,710
你能不能把注意力集中在上面？
can you help me out by just having your attention up here?

574
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,461
好吧。
Alright.

575
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,254
好的。
Okay.

576
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,466
我想邀请四五个同学
So can I hear from four or five people

577
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,594
用一个词能形容一下你刚才的感受？
one word that describes what that was like for you?

578
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,637
冷静。
Calm.

579
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,471
冷静？
Calm?

580
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,680
你认为这是一个
And would you describe that as 

581
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,974
愉快的还是不愉快的经历？
a pleasant or unpleasant experience?

582
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,933
愉快的。
Pleasant.

583
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,101
谢谢你的分享。
Thank you for sharing.

584
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,103
莫妮卡，你到外面去。
Monica, go outside.

585
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,440
你真的太干扰大家了。
You do too much, for real.

586
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,485
我知道你不喜欢期望。
I know you don't like expectations.

587
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,154
我喜欢，但我不喜欢你的。
I do, but I don't like yours.

588
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,948
这并不是说很难达到他们的要求，
It's not like it's hard to reach them,

589
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,584
只是他们表现得好像
it's just like they wanna act 

590
00:24:11,584 --> 00:24:13,160
他们并不真正关心什么似的。
like they don't really care about nothing.

591
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,246
但我知道他们在乎。
But I know that they do care.

592
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,081
他们想表现得很强硬。
They're trying to act like they're tough.

593
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,667
当他们真的没有比那更好的时候，
They try to act like, oh, I'm better than this, you know,

594
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,295
他们试图表现得好像，哦，我可以更好。
when they're really not better than that.

595
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,839
关于一分钟的正念呼吸，
Raise your hand if something about

596
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:30,010
如果有什么不愉快的感觉的同学，请举手。
a minute of mindful breathing was unpleasant.

598
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,512
我不习惯如此安静的呼吸。
I'm not used to breathing so quiet.

599
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,347
我在旧金山住了很久,
I've lived in San Francisco for a long time,

600
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,641
所以总能听到汽车之类的声音。
so you always hear like cars and stuff.

601
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,186
而且声音不吵，所以。
And it wasn't noisy, so.

602
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,813
好吧，你已经习惯旧金山的噪音了。
Okay, so you're used to the noise in San Francisco.

603
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,154
我们现在要用钵声结束今天的课程。
So we're gonna end right now with the bell.

604
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,739
嘘。
Ssh.

606
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,249
我们做了正念呼吸,
We did do mindful breathing,

607
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,418
所以我完成了我的意图,
and so I accomplished what the intention was,

608
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,046
但是我觉得这个班级并没有真正理解。
but it didn't feel like the class really got it.

609
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,465
这次课总共花了35分钟。
And it took 35 minutes.

610
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,468
真的想找到一种方法来触达他们，
You just really want to find a way to reach them and

611
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,928
但没找到，所以我不知道,
you're not, and so I don't know,

612
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,930
我不知道下一步该怎么做。
I don't know where to go next with it.

613
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,311
嘿，那是马利克。
Hey, there's Malik.

614
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,688
他们绕过拐角。
They go around the corner.

615
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,735
史蒂文 · 霍普金斯和我一起上课后班。
Steven Hopkins goes to After School with me.

616
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,903
这样我们才能远离麻烦。
That's how we stay out of trouble.

617
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,572
学期开始时，我的成绩都是 A。
In the beginning, I had like, all As.

618
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,783
在学期中间，我开始不想
And during the middle I just started not wanting to

619
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,992
做作业了。
do my work and stuff.

620
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,370
我只是去学校，甚至什么都不做，
I would just go to school and not even do anything,

621
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,039
不做什么作业，就去玩。
just not do my work, go have fun.

622
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,915
你想做什么？
What do you want to do?

623
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,124
不做什么。
Yeah, nothing.

624
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,042
很好。
That's good.

625
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,169
不过有点快。
Kind of fast though.

626
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,003
是吗？
Does it?

627
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:47,546
是的。
Yeah.

628
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,631
每次他回家，我都会问他你还好吗？
When he comes home, I always ask him are you okay?

629
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,216
学校怎么样，你做了什么？
How was school, what did you did?

630
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,634
有什么变化吗，有什么问题吗？
Anything change, anything wrong?

631
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,345
我试图至少了解
So I try to get at least an idea of what happens

632
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,680
他一天中发生的事情。
during the day for him.

633
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,433
如果我只是把他晾在一边，从不和他说话，
If I just put him on the side and never talk to him,

634
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,685
或者不关心他做了什么,
or don't care about what he does,

635
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,852
那就不一样了。
then that's different.

636
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,563
是的。
Yeah.

637
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,439
杰拉尔多现在有麻烦了。
Gerardo is in trouble now.

638
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,525
在过去也许，我会说在一年或一年半的时间里,
For the past maybe, I would say a year, year and a half,

639
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,944
我们和他之间存在很大的问题。
we're having really hard issues with him.

640
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:11,778
上学迟到。
Tardiness.

641
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,238
出勤率低。
Attendance.

642
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,656
行为表现差。
Behavior.

643
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,908
他交的朋友，他做的事都有问题。
The friends that he hands with and the things that he does.

644
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,952
就好像如果你做得好，他们就会给你加分。
It's like if you're doing good, they give you pluses.

645
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,954
如果你在外面鬼混，或者不在座位上什么的,
If you're fooling around or not in your seat or something,

646
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,205
他们就会给你减分。
they give you circles.

647
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,082
你今天得了多少 “+” ？
How many pluses you got today?

648
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,502
总数还是在小组里。
Altogether or in the group.

649
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,336
共八个。
Eight.

650
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,172
在你们十号组呢？
In your group, in table ten?

651
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,132
- 有八个“好”?              - 是的。
- Eight good?                - Yeah.

652
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:32,841
“差”有几个？
How many bad?

653
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,842
七个。
Seven.

655
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,178
我们在做加减计算吗？
Are we doing equal here?

656
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,471
最后的表现是负数还是正数？
Are we doing minus or plus?

657
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,598
来吧。
Come on.

658
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,141
有时候会有人推介我,
And I was getting referrals sometimes,

659
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,018
一天五次推介，还有他做的事,
five referrals a day, and the thing with him,

660
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,519
他喜欢顶嘴。
he likes to talk back.

661
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,854
有一次我上班的时候，学校打电话给我说：
One time they called me at work and says,

662
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,981
“你得马上来接杰拉尔多。
you have to come pick up Gerardo right now.

663
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,399
我们不能再让他留在学校了”。
We cannot keep him in school no more.

664
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,151
我说，现在是早上11点。
And I'm like, it's 11 in the morning.

665
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,861
他说，你得来接他。
He says well, you need to come pick him up.

666
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,197
他们巴不得你离开这个地方，不要再回来了。
They just want you to leave the premise and don't come back.

667
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,532
这是很糟糕的。
That is pretty bad.

668
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,533
但我当时做得很好。
But I was doing good, though.

669
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,410
我明白，但要多久？
I understand, but for how long?

670
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,496
我毕业于玛丽娜中学。
I graduated from Marina Middle School.

671
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,498
我和杰拉尔多一模一样。
I was exactly like Gerardo.

672
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,666
我很聪明。
I was very smart.

673
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:11,671
实际上，我曾是六个月的月度最佳学生，
I was actually the student of the month for six months.

675
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:15,091
我有大约六个月的荣誉榜。
I had honor roll for about six months.

677
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,135
然后一切都变糟了。
And then everything went down sour, too.

678
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,762
我开始和不三不四的人混在一起,
I started hanging with the wrong crowd,

679
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,805
答非所问，不做作业,
answering back, not doing homework,

680
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,350
直到最后我被学校开除。
until eventually I got kicked out of school.

681
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,101
有时候我在课堂上胡闹。
Sometimes I fool around in class.

682
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,771
哦，这我知道，你不用告诉我。
Oh, that I know, you don't have to tell me.

683
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,606
你认为你为什么坐在前面？
Why do you think you sit in the front?

684
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,524
因为你很特别？
'Cause you're special?

685
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,109
因为我爱我的老师。
'Cause I love my teacher.

686
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,235
不，你不爱。
No, you don't.

687
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,278
好吧。
Alright.

688
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,112
不，有关系。
No, it's not alright.

689
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,365
别只告诉我好吧，别只告诉我要安静,
Don't just tell me alright just to tell me to be quiet,

690
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,408
我只想表达我的观点。
I'm trying to make a point here.

691
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,577
对我来说按时上班是不公平的，
It would not be fair for me to go to work on time

692
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,830
当每次我准时上班时，其他人都迟到。
and have everybody else be late when I'm on time every time.

693
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:47,049
我知道我的工作是什么，
I know what my job is, 

694
00:27:47,049 --> 00:27:50,043
我不需要有人来告诉我我要做什么工作。
I don't need someone to come tell me you need to do your job.

695
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:50,418
是的。
Yeah.

696
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,545
有一些小事情，我很后悔我做了，
There's little things out there that I regret I done

697
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,090
而我，相信，我若可以回去，我会改变它的。
and I was, believe, I coulda go back, I woulda change it.

698
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,883
这就是我想教他的,
That's the thing that I'm trying to teach him,

699
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,760
我说，我可以做你的镜子，看看我在哪里。
I says look at my mirror, look where I am.

700
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,011
看看我都经历了什么。
Look what I gone through.

701
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,847
我一直在洗碗，我一直在做门卫工作,
I been doing dishes, I been doing janitorial work,

702
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,225
我做过各种各样的工作。
I been doing all kind of jobs.

703
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,601
我一直在街上卖水果,
I've been selling fruits in the street,

704
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,937
对我来说，这不是什么新鲜事，但对他来说,
so to me, that's nothing new, but for him,

705
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:12,148
他有机会和可能性成为这里的一员,
that he has the chance and the opportunity to be somebody here,

707
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,818
他只是没有利用这一点,
he just doesn't take advantage of it,

708
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,861
我觉得这是浪费时间。
I think it's a waste of time.

709
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,737
我不认为学校...
I don't think the school...

710
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,323
但他需要想出更好的选择。
but he needs to come up with better choices, though.

711
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,241
对吧？
Right?

712
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,075
是的。
Yeah.

714
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,665
听起来好像我们在香港。
Sound like we're in Hong Kong.

715
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,125
大家注意了。
Can I have your attention.

716
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,670
周一的事,
So the way things went on Monday,

717
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,798
对正念来说是行不通的，所以我需要找出
it's not gonna work for mindfulness, so I need to find out

718
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,634
谁真的不想在这里参加正念。
who really does not want to be here for mindfulness.

719
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,220
如果你不想待在这里，
I'm gonna need each of you that are raising your hand

720
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,764
你们可以举手示意，并告诉我为什么。
that you don't want to be here, to tell me why.

721
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,225
所以你不想来是因为？
So you don't want to be here because?

722
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,309
很无聊吗？
It's boring?

723
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,061
又无聊又愚蠢。
It's boring and it's stupid.

724
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,605
你有没有发现你生命中有什么东西是无聊或愚蠢的？
Do you ever find other things in your life boring or stupid?

726
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,481
没有。
No.

727
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,441
没有，从来没有？
No, never?

728
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,316
所以这是唯一的喽？
So this is the only thing?

729
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,609
你真的想出去吗？
So you definitely wanna go?

730
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,444
是的。
Yeah.

731
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,361
好的。
Okay.

732
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,613
有几个孩子
There are a few kids

733
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,700
对班上其他人特别有挑战性。
who make the rest of the class particularly challenging.

734
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,453
如果他们中的五个人不在教室里，
If there were five of them that weren't in there,

735
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,038
那么其他大多数同学实际上就会尝试，
then the majority of them actually would be trying

736
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,790
也会参与到正念课程中。
and would be participating.

737
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,459
迭戈，过来。
Diego, come here.

738
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,293
站起来。
And stand up.

739
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,756
请走到这里来。
Just come all the way over here.

740
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,095
好了，他们和你们一起出去。
Okay, they're just gonna head outside with you guys.

741
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,263
我们将在你们不在的情况下上课。
And we're gonna have the class without you.

742
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,347
谢谢你。
Thank you.

743
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,475
作为一个项目，我们的理念是
It's our philosophy as a program that 

744
00:29:28,475 --> 00:29:30,060
所有学生都要在课堂上，
all students are present in the class,

745
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:31,603
即使他们是捣蛋鬼，
even if they are the disruptive ones, 
 
 745
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,179
因为我们相信他们甚至
because we believe that they are the ones

746
00:29:33,179 --> 00:29:35,315
可能是获得最大利益的人。
that might even gain the most benefit.

747
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,901
但是，现在我所看到的是，
But, right now what I'm seeing is

748
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:40,945
有几个孩子造成了如此多的破坏，
there's a handful of kids that are causing so much disruption, 

749
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:44,574
以至于牺牲了班上其他30个孩子的利益。
that it's at the expense of the other 30 kids in the class.

751
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,745
30个孩子正在等着班上所有同学都安静下来。
30 kids are waiting for the class to settle down.

752
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,079
如果你现在要参加这个课程,
If you're participating in the class,

753
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,123
请把椅子转向前方。
please turn your chairs this way.

754
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,541
大家往这里看。
Everybody's eyes up here.

755
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,002
克里斯？
Chris?

756
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,008
当我在结束时环顾四周，有一个男孩如此
It really did strike me when I looked around at the end

757
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:05,595
专注地看着我，这确实让我印象深刻，
and there was one boy just looking at me so intently, 

758
00:30:05,595 --> 00:30:07,721
然后我环顾四周，我意识到，
and then I looked around and I realized, 

759
00:30:07,721 --> 00:30:09,600
好吧，有一半的人只是在等待
well, a good half of the class is just waiting  

760
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,768
班上其他的人振作起来。
for the rest of the class to get it together.

762
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,189
一些已经准备好并愿意做的人
Some of the people that are ready and willing to do it

763
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,334
会感到不舒服，
are not gonna feel comfortable 

764
00:30:18,334 --> 00:30:20,235
除非班上其他同学都安顿好了。
unless the rest of the class is settled in.

765
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,197
你为什么不问问这里所有的孩子
So why don't you ask all the kids in here

766
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,908
他们现在感觉舒服吗？
if they're feeling comfortable right now?

767
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,786
这是我一直想进行的对谈。
That's a conversation that I've been trying to have.

768
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,583
所以当钵声消失的时候请举手。
So raise your hand when the sound of the bell is gone.

771
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,303
哦，我们本来要去吃午饭的。
Oh, we're supposed to be going to lunch.

772
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,016
就像头撞南墙。
It's like hitting a brick wall.

773
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:56,396
我很沮丧，有点无可奈何。
I just am frustrated and kind of hopeless.

774
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,065
反抗是如此的刻意，
The defiance is so deliberate and

775
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,150
我不知道我是否能在这么大的
I don't know if I can work with that

776
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,611
一个团体中解决这个问题。
in this large of a group.

777
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:16,583
因此，我和布拉克斯顿先生和布什小姐坐下来，
So, I sat down with Mister Braxton and Miss Busche to ask

778
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,419
商议我该如何回应这堂课。
how I should respond to this class.

779
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:22,880
我在这些孩子身上特别遇到的问题是，
The problem that I'm meeting with these kids in particular is 

781
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:25,925
有四个孩子在故意捣乱，
that four kids are being deliberately disruptive

782
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,469
牺牲了其他30个学生的利益。
at the expense of 30 other students.

783
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,762
我们是一所公立学校。
We're a public school.

784
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:31,390
我们因材施教每位学生，
We take everybody where they're at 

785
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,225
并尽我们所能为他们做最好的工作，
and we do the best job we can with them

786
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:37,896
那种认为30个孩子在等5个孩子的想法...
and the idea that 30 kids are waiting for five kids...

787
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,396
是的。
Yeah.

788
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,857
或者认为这些孩子是受害者，
Or that somehow these kids are the victims

789
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,485
或者认为他们不会以牺牲别人为代价来获得某些东西,
or they're not getting something at the expense of others,

790
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,446
这是我不想建立的模式,
that's a paradigm I prefer not to set up,

791
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,031
即有些人有收获，而有些人没有，
that some get and some don't

792
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,617
牺牲五个学生的利益以便让其他人有收获。
and that we sacrifice five so that others do.

793
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:53,286
我们应该给每个学生同样的东西。
We should give the same thing to everybody.

795
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,829
不过，它可能不会以同样的方式出现。
It may not come in the same way, though.

796
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,830
我对此并不介意。
And I'm okay with that.

797
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,916
我们一天一天慢慢来。
Let's take this one day at a time.

798
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,877
今天我们要带他们四个出去上课。
And today we'll take those four out for the class.

799
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,962
你会有一些时间和他们在一起，
You'll have some time with them and then maybe

800
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,131
然后你我也许可在我今天离开之前联系一下，
you and I can touch base before I leave today

801
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,425
听听他们的谈话情况如何。
just to hear how that conversation went.

802
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:09,761
然后当班级作为一个整体回来时，
And then reintegrating them when 

803
00:32:09,761 --> 00:32:12,020
再把他们重新整合起来，
that class comes back together as a whole, 

804
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:14,182
这对班上的四个孩子来说并不陌生。
it's not foreign to four kids in the class.

805
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:14,807
对的。
Right.

807
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,163
我开过一次家长会，情况很糟糕，
I had a parent teacher conference and it was bad,

808
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,541
因为老师们都在说我的坏话。
'cause the teachers were talking bad about me.

809
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,043
根本不做作业。
Not a lick of work.

810
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:45,213
数学作业，科学作业，什么都没上交,
Nothing turned in, math or science.

812
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,007
我总是在挂墙投影仪上这么做。
I always do this on the overhead projector.

813
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,509
通过不做作业,
By not doing homework,

814
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:53,012
她觉得这样才能报复老师。
she thinks that's the way she can get back at the teacher.

815
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,640
每天，她都应该能带
Everyday, she should be able to bring 

816
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,558
一份像这样的文件回家。
a paper home that looks like this.

817
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,477
这是我们今天在数学课上教的内容。
This is what we did in math class today.

818
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,271
她数学落后了，
She got behind in math and

819
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,940
阅读和写作也落后了,
reading and writing, also,

820
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,985
因为老师把她送到了办公室。
because the teacher sent her to the office.

822
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,112
 我们连续三天都在谈论这个问题。
We talked about it for three days in a row.

823
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,321
当我去学校时，
When I went to school,

824
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,657
完成家庭作业需要两三个小时，完成后，
homework means like two, three hours and then

825
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,200
我就有自由时间了。
I have my free time.

826
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,205
我，林恩和莱斯利 · 马丁内斯一起做的。
Me, Lyn and Lesly Martinez worked on it.

827
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,041
在美国，他们觉得很无聊。
In America, it's like, boring for them.

828
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,378
拿不拿到毕业证书，随便了。
Getting a diploma is like, whatever.

829
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,046
那会得到什么呢？
What is that going to get?

830
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,090
你真的不该觉得这很糟糕。
You really shouldn't even think that's bad.

831
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,383
你会为自己感到骄傲的。
You're gonna be so proud of yourself.

832
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,886
校长说如果她再犯错误的话，
The Principal said that if she gets one more thing,

833
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,888
她就得换个学校。
she'll have to change the school.

834
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,143
但我不想让她离开玛丽娜学校。
But I don't want her to get out of Marina.

835
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,227
我喜欢这所学校。
I like the school.

836
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,187
她可以表现得很好，
She could do very well

837
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,190
如果她集中精力，真的决定
if she focused and really decided

838
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,734
要成为一个优秀学生的话。
I'm gonna be a great student.

839
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,863
我想我必须改变我的整个态度，
I think I would have to change my whole attitude

840
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,698
开始好好学习，
and start doing my work

841
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,907
并完成作业。
and my homework.

842
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,452
所有的家庭作业。
All of my homework.

843
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,245
我想这真的取决于你。
I think it's really up to you.

844
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,564
我觉得你有足够的能力，
I think you have the resources and 

845
00:34:01,564 --> 00:34:04,292
只需要你决定做好你的那部分。
it just takes a decision on your part to do your part.

846
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,586
我希望能通过考试。
I hope to pass.

847
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,504
我有点难过。
I would feel kind of sad.

848
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:10,172
如果我不及格，
If I don't pass, 

849
00:34:10,172 --> 00:34:13,426
就不能和我的朋友们继续交往了。
then I don't get to go on with my friends and move on.

850
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,888
来学校整整一年，如果最后没有毕业，
Doesn't make any sense, to come to school for the full year

852
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,265
那就说不通了。
if at the end, you don't graduate.

853
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,099
我在浪费时间。
I waste my time.

854
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,434
我认为这是个警钟。
I did think that was a wake up call.

855
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,187
我离开学校时想着要好好学习，
I walked out thinking start doing good,

856
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,191
别再被老师点名批评了，开始做家庭作业和课堂作业。
stop getting referrals and start doing my homework and classwork.

858
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,907
当我早上醒来,
When I wake up in the morning,

859
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,825
想到今天是要去学校教书,
and it's the day that we're teaching at this school,

860
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,453
我心中就有一种轻微的恐惧，
I have a mixture of mild dread

861
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:45,083
也有一些关于我今天能做什么的决定。
and also some determination of what can I do today?

862
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:50,713
这些课程一直在我脑海里。
These classes are on my mind all the time.

864
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,507
当我觉得自己无法触及这些学生时,
When I feel like I'm not reaching them,

865
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,009
我觉得这是不可接受的，所以我想
that's not acceptable so I wanna get creative

866
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,095
发挥创造力并想办法触及他们。
and figure out how to reach 'em.

869
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:16,906
好吧。
Okay.

870
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:20,993
我打算让你们来引导正念。
I'm gonna have you guys start leading mindfulness.

872
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,037
请闭上眼睛。
Please let your eyes close.

874
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:48,604
我本来不打算今天在课堂上尝试正念，但我还是试了。
I wasn't planning to give it a try today in class but I kinda did.

876
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,777
好的，谢谢。
Okay, thank you.

877
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,444
好了，伙计们。
Alright, you guys.

878
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,448
你认为你生活中什么对你有最大影响？
What do you think is your biggest influence in your life?

879
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,868
每个人都开始提高注意力，
Everybody started paying attention

880
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,579
这与其他课程不同。
and it was different from the other classes.

881
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,538
莱斯利，你的答案是？
Lesly?

882
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,289
爸爸。
Dad.

883
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,373
爸爸。
Dad.

884
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,833
杰奎琳，你呢？
Jacqueline?

885
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,709
我姐姐。
My sister.

886
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,962
好的，我们有人说了爸爸和姐姐。
Okay, so we've got dad, sister.

887
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:13,546
杰拉尔多，你呢？
Gerardo?

888
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,380
艺术。
Art.

889
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,214
艺术。
Art.

890
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,300
如果我告诉你，你生命中对你有
Would you be surprised if I told you

891
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,553
最大影响的是你的心智，你会感到惊讶吗？
the biggest influence in your life is your mind?

892
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,432
当我们练习正念时，
And when we practice mindfulness, 

893
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,100
你正在加强你的心智，
you're strengthening your mind 

894
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,727
让它对你的生活产生你想要的影响。
to have the influence  on your life that you want it to have.

895
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,855
当我们练习正念呼吸时,
And when we practice mindful breathing,

896
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,608
我们正在发展心智的力量，
we're developing the strength of our mind

897
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,526
以便对我们产生影响。
to have influence on us.

898
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,904
我很难坐着不动，
It was hard to sit still

899
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,656
很难不动手或任何东西。
and to not move my hands or anything.

900
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,411
这就像，好吧，我只需要冷静下来，
It was just like, okay, I just need to calm down and

901
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:49,123
告诉自己不要动，看看这样行不行。
tell myself to stop moving to see if this works or not.

902
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,335
我们可以用想法在我们的生活中
One way that we can create influence in our life

903
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,589
产生影响的一种方式是聚焦意图，
with our mind is by having thoughts on purpose,

904
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,633
而不是胡思乱想。
rather than thoughts on accident.

905
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,261
因此，继续前进，回到一个正念的体态。
So go ahead and get back into a mindful position.

906
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,098
我要说一句话。
I'm gonna say a phrase.

907
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:10,436
我想让你们在心里默默地重复念的一句话是：
So the first thing I want you to repeat, silently in your mind, is

909
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:14,148
我祝自己快乐。
I wish for myself to be happy.

911
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,526
然后试试这个愿望，我祝自己健康。
And then try the wish, I wish for myself to be healthy.

912
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:25,534
现在在你的脑海中创造一个针对你自己的愿望，
And now create a wish in your mind that is specific to yourself,

914
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,703
无论是你想要完成的事情，
whether it's something you want to accomplish,

915
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,622
还是你想要拥有的品质，
a quality that you want to have,

916
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,249
还是你想要做的事情。
something you want to do.

917
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,292
我为自己许愿,
I wish for myself,

918
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,710
你们来填空。
you fill in the blank.

919
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:50,142
它只是帮助你放松，忘记其他的事情。
It just helps you relax and forget about everything else.

920
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,061
有没有人愿意说说
Is anyone willing to say

921
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,355
为自己许下了什么愿望？
what they wished for themselves?

922
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,440
是的，你对自己许了什么愿望？
Yes, what was your wish for yourself?

923
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,608
更轻松惬意的生活。
An easier life.

924
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,652
谢谢。
Thank you.

925
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,486
杰拉尔多，你呢？
Gerardo?

926
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,780
在学校表现更好。
To do better in school.

927
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,656
太好了。
Great.

928
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,157
在他的课上表现更好。
In his class.

929
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,784
谢谢。
Thank you.

930
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,703
你希望在学校表现得更好,
You wish to do better in school,

931
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,413
尤其是埃恩勒先生的课上。
particularly Mister Ehnle's class.

932
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:10,955
是的。
Yeah.

933
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,332
我想搬到阿拉斯加。
I want to move to Alaska.

934
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,667
你想搬到阿拉斯加？
You wish to move to Alaska?

935
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,209
是的。
Yeah.

936
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,169
好的，太好了，谢谢。
Okay, great, thank you.

937
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,965
如果这是你第一次对
Raise your hand if this was the first time that you

938
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,759
幸福有了目的性的想法，请举手。
had thoughts on purpose about your happiness.

939
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,095
好的。
Okay.

940
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:30,224
今天我想让你们祝自己幸福三次。
I want you, three times today, wish yourself happiness.

941
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:30,641
好吗？
Okay?

942
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,893
但你们的挑战是要记住做这件事。
But your challenge is to remember to do it.

943
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,479
我想对你们今天的参与
And I want to express my deep appreciation

944
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,440
表示深深的感谢。
for your participation today.

945
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,192
今天的课确实让我感到更有希望，
Today's class definitely does make me feel more hopeful

946
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,361
我们会在这门课上有所收获。
that we're gonna get somewhere in this class.

947
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,739
今天那间教室真的发生了变化，
That room really shifted today and I felt like

948
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,199
我感觉学生们真的以一种对他们有帮助的
the students really participated in a way that

949
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,285
方式参与进来，对每个人都有帮助，
was helpful to them, as in each individual,

950
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,203
对整个教室也有帮助。
but also as a classroom.

951
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,830
好的，谢谢。
Okay, thanks.

952
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,081
谢谢你 ，埃恩勒先生。
Thank you, Mister Ehnle.

953
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,044
我对正念课程有些想法。
I have thoughts about the mindfulness program.

954
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,213
我非常愿意参与，
I'm perfectly willing to participate and

955
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:04,133
我希望它能帮助学生学习，
I hope it helps students in learning 

956
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:07,053
并有效地利用
and effectively using the opportunity

957
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,222
他们在中学经历的这个机会。
that is their middle school experience.

959
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,908
六，七，八。
Six, seven, eight.

960
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,536
早上好。
Good morning, again.

961
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,162
嗨。
Hi.

962
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,080
嗨。
Hi.

00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,247
早上好。
Good morning.

964
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,374
近来可好？
How are you?

965
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,416
很好。
Good.

966
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,711
我们要进入正念的倾听。
We're gonna go into mindful listening.

967
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,089
当尝试一些你可能以前没有做过的事情时，
I encourage you to have an open mind this morning,

968
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:46,133
我鼓励你们今天早上有一个开放的心态。
while we try something that you probably haven't done before.

971
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:54,433
把你的注意力放在声音上，
Keeping your attention on sound, 

972
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,437
听房间外面的声音。
listen to the sounds outside the room.

974
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,656
然后专注于你内心的声音。
And then focus on the sounds inside of you.

975
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,293
一开始，因为她的穿着，
At first, well, I thought she was like a voodoo person,

976
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,796
我以为她是个巫毒教徒。
'cause of what she was wearing.

977
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,383
你们真的很正念。
You guys got really mindful.

978
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,968
你能确定你听外面的
Can you identify how you felt

979
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,886
声音有什么感觉吗？
listening to the sounds outside?

980
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,263
我有点不耐烦。
I was a little impatient.

981
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,222
有点不耐烦？
A little impatient?

982
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,056
是的。
Yeah.

983
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,057
是啊，怎么了？
Yeah, why?

984
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,935
因为我习惯了动来动去和接头接耳。
'Cause I'm used to  and chatting a lot.

985
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,813
没错，你们习惯了动来动去和接头接耳，
You're used to moving and chatting, exactly.

987
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,982
所以尽量正念倾听声音,
So try to be mindful of sounds,

988
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,901
外在的、内在的，你自己内心的声音。
outside, inside, inside yourself.

989
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,653
我们周一见。
And I will see you on Monday.

990
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,989
再次感谢你们，你们太棒了。
Thank you again, you guys, that was great.

992
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,536
正念课程是,
Mindfulness program is,

993
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:57,663
没关系的，都很好。
it's alright, it's okay.

995
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,624
我认为这会帮助那些
I think it'll only help certain kids

996
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,585
真正对正念感兴趣的孩子。
that really is interested in it.

997
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,171
有些孩子来学校是因为
Some kids just come to school because

998
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,922
他们只是想来这里社交。
they just feel like socializing.

999
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,341
还有其他一些孩子,
And some of the other kids,

1000
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:12,427
他们对学校和
they're more interested in school and 

1001
00:41:12,427 --> 00:41:15,222
学校里的课程更感兴趣。
the programs that happen at the school.

1003
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:28,694
奥马尔，他在学校惹了不少麻烦。
Omar, he was really getting a lot of trouble in school.

1004
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,696
他的成绩一直是F。
He had straight Fs.

1005
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:34,241
哦，他会说有一门是 D， 但对我来说，那还是全F。
Oh, he'll say one D, but to me, that's still straight Fs.

1006
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,036
有严重的纪律问题,
Had very bad discipline problems,

1007
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,539
有不按老师说的做的纪律问题。
a discipline problem with not doing what the teacher says.

1008
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,791
而且还是个问题少年。
And just a problem kid.

1009
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,713
你还好吗？
How you doing?

1010
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,173
今天过得怎么样？
How was your day?

1011
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,049
很好。
Good.

1013
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,889
你的哮喘怎么样了？
How's your asthma?

1014
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,723
没问题。
Alright.

1015
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,726
我和我丈夫，我们认为他和我们
Me and my husband, we thought it would be best

1016
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,562
是最好的，因为我刚刚退休了。
for him to stay with us, as I had just retired.

1017
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,855
这里有些饼干。
There's some cookies.

1018
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,442
有什么进展吗？
What you got, progress report?

1019
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,693
是的。
Yeah.

1020
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,070
他带回来一份进度报告,
He brings home a progress report,

1021
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,905
这是他必须带回家的东西之一,
that's one of the things that he's required to bring home,

1022
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,573
每天都要给我。
to me, everyday.

1023
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:18,244
自从他去了玛丽娜学校后，每天都是这样。
And that's been every day since he's been going to Marina.

1024
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,703
伊尔斯小姐的报告呢？
But, what about Miss Illes?

1025
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,455
没有伊尔斯小姐的报告。
There's nothing for Miss Illes.

1026
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,415
每天我都在向你要。
Everyday I've been asking you for.

1027
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,168
奥马尔不听话的时候会很有挑战性。
Omar can be quite challenging when he's defiant.

1028
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,920
很有挑战性。
Quite challenging.

1029
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,588
我忘了。
I forget.

1030
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,215
但这是不可接受的，对吧？
But that's not acceptable, right?

1031
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,091
好吧。
Alright.

1032
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,927
你什么时候才能想起来？
So when are you gonna start remembering?

1033
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,265
我需要知道她说了什么，我知道你告诉我了什么。
I need to know what she says, I know what you tell me.

1034
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,268
她对我有期望。
She has expectations from me.

1035
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,353
她只是想让我在学校好好表现。
She just wants me to do good in school.

1036
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,772
我需要你记下她对你的评价。
I need you to put down what she says about you.

1037
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,525
她要我好好表现。
She's pushing me to do well.

1038
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,819
有时候我不怎么听她的。
Sometimes I don't really listen to her.

1039
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,237
我只是今天早上没做。
I just didn't do it this morning.

1040
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,613
我觉得你应该要多做点。
I think you need to start doing more.

1041
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,407
我不在乎,
I don't really care,

1042
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,742
我跟她没什么好说的。
I don't have nothing to say to her.

1043
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:02,705
我只是想看到你有所进步，你知道吗？
I just want to see some improvement from you, you know?

1044
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,298
抚养奥马尔最大的好处就是
The best thing about raising Omar is

1045
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,591
因为我已经退休了,
since I'm retired now,

1046
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,135
我有很多时间和他在一起,
I get to spend a lot of time with him,

1047
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,971
而之前，我在工作，努力维持生计,
whereas before, I was working, trying to make ends meet,

1048
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,139
匆匆忙忙地吃晚饭。
rushing with dinner.

1049
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,266
根本没时间坐下，
Just didn't have that time to sit

1050
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,810
我真的很感激他的到来。
and really appreciate him being there.

1051
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,315
现在，我喜欢这样。
But now, I love it.

1052
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,150
只是陪在他身边。
Just being there for him.

1053
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,657
他是一个优秀的人，有一颗宽广的心。
He's a great person, he has a big heart.

1054
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:42,286
但是，他有很多失望的情绪不断浮现。
But, he has a lot of disappointment that keeps surfacing.

1055
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,370
为什么？
Why?

1056
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,289
因为我要赢。
'Cause I'm gonna win.

1057
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,582
好吧，我们来玩骑马吧。
Alright, let's play Horse, though.

1058
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,250
他需要学习如何
He needs to learn how to

1059
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,211
处理那些失望或消极情绪,
handle those disappointments or negativity,

1060
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,964
这样他就不会觉得自己输了。
so he doesn't feel like he's lost the battle.

1061
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,761
球上一定有黄油。
Must be butter on the ball.

1062
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,511
不是黄油,
It's no butter,

1063
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,679
你手指上可能有黄油。
there's probably butter on your fingers.

1064
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,930
通过练习,
With practice,

1065
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,516
正念会对他起作用，
mindfulness would work for him

1066
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:09,396
但要穿越那道愤怒的帷幕，
but it would really be hard to get through that curtain of anger,

1068
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:12,775
应对它，对他来说，真得很难。
getting hold of it for him to grasp it.

1070
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,279
我们会穿越过去的，
We're gonna get through that,

1071
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,239
正念会有所帮助。
and mindfulness is going to help.

1073
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,003
今天我给你们带了点东西。
Today I brought you something.

1074
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,923
我带来的是我们可以吃的东西。
What I brought is something that we can eat.

1075
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:40,052
我带来的是我们可以吃的葡萄干。
What I brought that we can eat is raisins.

1077
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,392
好的，谁能告诉我你听到此的三种反应。
Okay, so somebody tell me your three reactions.

1078
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:46,892
好吗？
Yeah?

1079
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,353
我的第一反应是很兴奋。
My first reaction, I was excited.

1080
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,814
第二个是,
Second one,

1081
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,648
我想,
I was like,

1082
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,900
好吧。
okay.

1083
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,069
兴奋感消失了。
The excitement kinda went away.

1084
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,737
然后你说到葡萄干。
Then you said raisins.

1085
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,114
我不吃葡萄干。
I don't eat raisins.

1087
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,242
我把葡萄干分给大家。
I'm gonna hand them out.

1088
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,744
大家现在拿着，先别吃。
So just hold it right now, don't eat 'em yet.

1089
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,747
我想让你们做的是
So what I'd like you to do is

1090
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:09,790
张开你们的嘴。
open your mouth.

1091
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,084
嘘，我们要安静地吃。
Ssh, we're gonna do this quietly.

1092
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,044
花整整一分钟来咀嚼。
And take a whole minute to chew it.

1093
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,129
整整一分钟？
A whole minute?

1094
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,465
我想让你们留意的是
And what I want you to pay attention to

1095
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,594
看看葡萄干的滋味有何变化。
is how your raisin changes.

1096
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,597
太酸了。
It's so sour.

1097
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:30,185
我们要把正念带入我们的整个体验，
We want to bring mindfulness into our entire experience,

1099
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,104
而不仅仅是闭着眼睛坐着。
not just sitting still with our eyes closed.

1100
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:37,109
正念饮食让我们有机会尝试
Mindful eating gives us a chance to experiment with

1101
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,612
在我们每天所做的事情中更加处在当下。
being extra present in something that we do everyday.

1102
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,948
我要你注意它的味道，感受它是如何变化的。
I want you to notice the flavor, how it changes.

1103
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,033
其质地，是如何变化的。
The texture, how it changes.

1104
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,786
在某种程度上，我们一天中的每一刻，
Every moment of our day includes our senses to some extent, 

1105
00:45:47,786 --> 00:45:50,831
这是一个很好的把我们所有感官都带入这一刻的方式。
so it's a great way to bring them all together in that one moment.

1107
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:52,416
但你们面临的挑战是，
But your challenge is, 

1107
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:54,501
下一次你在吃你喜欢的东西时，
the next time that you are eating something that you like, 

1108
00:45:54,501 --> 00:45:56,837
我希望你留心你所吃的东西，
I want you to be mindful of it 

1109
00:45:56,462 --> 00:46:00,966
以便你能以不同于过去的方式体验它。
so that you can experience it differently than you have in the past.

1111
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,343
好吗？
Okay?

1112
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,303
谢谢你们。
Thank you, you guys.

1113
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,554
祝你们这周过得愉快。
Have a great rest of your week.

1114
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,930
下周见。
I'll see you next week.

1115
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,978
5.5美元。
It's $5.50.

1116
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,823
你们准备好了吗？
You guys ready?

1116
00:46:25,115 --> 00:46:28,823
杰奎琳和她的朋友们正在为即将举行的才艺表演排练。

1117
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,829
来吧。
Come on.

1118
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,373
过来。
Come here.

1120
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,177
我爱我的朋友们。
I love my friends.

1121
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,804
我可以告诉他们任何事。
I can tell them anything.

1122
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,518
这是我来学校的唯一原因,
That's the only reason why I come to school,

1123
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,394
会见我的朋友们。
to come see my friends.

1124
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,315
我不喜欢上课，
I don't like being in class

1125
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,525
因为很无聊。
'cause it's boring.

1126
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,112
我认为正念比课堂更无聊。
I think mindfulness is more boring than class.

1127
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,531
好了，等等，停下。
Okay, wait, wait, stop.

1128
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,949
好了，继续。
Okay, go.

1129
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:10,369
一，一，二，三，一，二，三。
One, one, two, three, one, two, three.

1130
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:15,040
在学校，每个人都想看到自己能飞多高走多远,
At school, everybody trying to see how far they can go,

1132
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,416
杰奎琳也一样。
that including Jacqueline.

1133
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,128
你们俩把那该死的椅子挪开。
Move the damn chairs, you two.

1135
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,674
就站在那里。
Stand right there.

1136
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,425
我不会把一切都告诉我父母。
I don't tell my parents everything.

1137
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,886
我父母对任何事都太认真了。
Parents take everything too seriously.

1138
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,224
如果不想在 20 岁、22 岁时挣扎，
She have to be a better person if she don't want to

1139
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,394
她必须成为有着更好状态的人。
struggle when she gets 20, 22.

1140
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:41,149
我认为这在某个时点会影响到她。
I think it's going to get into her at some point.

1142
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,236
如果你生命中有人
Raise your hand if you have somebody in your life

1143
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,405
和你有矛盾，但她/他却是
who you have difficulty with but it's somebody

1144
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,700
你非常在乎或爱的人，请举手。
that you care about a lot or you love.

1146
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,578
想想你在乎的这个人,
And bring to mind this person who you care about,

1147
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,746
这个也许有些挑战。
but maybe there's some challenge with.

1148
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,373
请默念：
Repeat silently,

1149
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,626
祝你快乐。
I wish for you to be happy.

1150
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,297
祝你快乐。
I wish for you to be happy.

1151
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:05,340
自从我父母分手后，
Ever since my parents broke up, 

1152
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:09,011
我真的不在乎我是否生气。
I really didn't care if I was angry or not.

1153
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,764
我的老师和一切，好像我真的不在乎
My teachers and everything, like I really didn't care

1154
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,934
他们是否会对我感到失望或者别的什么。
if they were frustrated with me or anything.

1155
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,978
我祝你平安无事。
I wish for you to be safe.

1156
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,233
我祝你平安无事。
I wish for you to be safe.

1157
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,569
杰拉尔多对我很生气。
Gerardo has a lot of anger towards me.

1158
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,614
我觉得我们和大家一样有起有落。
I think we have up and downs like everybody.

1159
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:32,618
有时候我们相处得很好，我们在一起很开心,
Sometimes we get along good, we have fun together,

1160
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,453
我们一起共度时光。
we spend time together.

1161
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,705
而有时候我们就是合不来。
And sometimes we just don't get along.

1162
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,084
有时候我觉得是因为我没和他爸爸住在一起，
Sometimes I think it's because I'm not living with his dad

1163
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,378
他很难理解
and it's hard for him to understand 

1164
00:48:43,378 --> 00:48:45,213
我们不再在一起了。
that we're not together anymore.

1165
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,302
每个人找一个与这个人有关的
Find a wish on your own that's meaningful

1166
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,971
有意义的愿望，然后你们来许愿。
regarding this person, and you make the wish.

1167
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,306
你们选个愿望。
You choose the wish.

1168
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,770
有时候妈妈会对我大喊大叫。
Sometimes mom, she yells at me.

1169
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,647
整个地方就像
The whole place just feels all

1170
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,066
一锅正在煮的水，你知道吗？
like a pot of water that's cooking, you know?

1171
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,150
气氛非常紧张。
It's all heated.

1172
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,693
有时候你可以逃避,
Sometimes you can run away form it,

1173
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,111
而有时候你真的做不到。
sometimes you really can't.

1174
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,197
有时候，你必须在那里,
Sometimes you just gotta like, be there,

1175
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,200
然后你就会被灼伤。
and you gotta burn, the little pot thing.

1176
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,202
把注意力停留在你的身体上,
Let your attention rest in your body,

1177
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,747
注意你的身体和头脑的感受。
just noticing how your body feels and how your mind feels.

1178
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:28,382
我想让杰拉尔多毕业，拿到学位。
I want Gerardo to graduate, have a degree.

1179
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,175
我知道他能做到,
I know that he can do it,

1180
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:32,930
但现在时机不对，
but right now it's tough timing, 

1181
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:35,347
对他来说在学校集中注意力真的很难。
it's really hard for him to focus in school.

1182
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,308
但我希望他能在生活中出人头地。
But I want him to be somebody in life.

1183
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,309
太棒了,
That was great,

1184
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:41,480
但我真的很好奇是否有人
but I'm really curious if anyone is 

1185
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,271
愿意分享刚才做的时候的感觉。
willing to share what that was like.

1186
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:48,861
房间里感觉很静，
The room felt still, 

1186
00:49:48,861 --> 00:49:51,086
但当我看着每个学生时，
but when I looked at each individual student, 

1187
00:49:51,086 --> 00:49:53,047
我不知道他们内在发生了什么，
I didn't know what was going on for them 

1188
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:56,326
他们并没有真正地主动交流与分享。
and they're not being really forthcoming and sharing.

1190
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,580
如果有人认为正念很有帮助，
Can I have a show of hands

1191
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,041
或者你从中学到了什么，
if anybody thought that it was helpful

1192
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,543
或者你意识到了什么，
or that you learned something,

1193
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,461
请举手示意。
or you realized something?

1194
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,047
到最后，我希望他们确实有一个工具，
By the end, hopefully they do have a tool that they can

1195
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:14,261
可以在需要的时候依赖或利用。
depend on or draw upon in moments of need.

1199
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,321
今天早上我用了正念，因为妈妈,
This morning I used mindfulness 'cause mom,

1200
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,616
她对我大喊大叫，因为我早上没起床。
she was yelling at me 'cause I didn't get up in the morning.

1201
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,909
我当时很生气。
And I was just mad.

1202
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,497
我只想锁上门，然后想,
I was just gonna lock the door and like,

1203
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,416
回去睡觉，今天不去上学了。
go back to sleep and not go to school today.

1204
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:47,576
但之后我冷静了一下，
But then I, I just chilled for a little bit, 

1206
00:50:47,576 --> 00:50:50,922
很快就用了正念，这让我感觉更平静。
I used mindfulness real quick and it made me feel more calm.

1207
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,216
这也让我清醒过来。
It kind of woke me up, too.

1208
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,554
后来我去上学了。
And I came to school.

1209
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,973
♪ 我会找到你
♪ Gonna find you 

1210
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,976
♪慢慢来
♪ And take it slowly 

1211
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,771
♪ 准备好了吗，我来了
♪ Ready or not, here I come 

1212
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,023
♪ 你躲不掉
♪ You can't hide 

1213
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,608
早上好。
Good morning.

1214
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,280
所以，这次我想尝试的是,
So, what I want to try this time,

1215
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,199
在你做正念呼吸的时候,
is while you're doing mindful breathing,

1216
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,118
我会故意发出一点点噪音。
I'm gonna deliberately gonna make a little bit of noise.

1217
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:24,040
使用锚词“吸气”和“呼气”
And using the anchor words breathing in and breathing out 

1219
00:51:24,040 --> 00:51:25,936
将帮助你保持专注于呼吸，
will help you stay focused on your breathing 

1220
00:51:25,936 --> 00:51:29,044
即使有一些分心或混乱的情况。
even when there's some distraction or chaos.

1223
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,926
吸气，呼气。
Breathing in, breathing out.

1225
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,105
在开始的时候，我并不惊讶，当事情变得安静时，
I wasn't surprised in the beginning when things got quiet

1226
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,982
人们会发出放屁的声音之类的。
people would like, make fart noises and stuff.

1227
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,820
但之后,
But later on,

1228
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,155
大概一个月后,
like maybe like a month later,

1229
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,865
事情就好起来了。
things got better.

1230
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,743
当她敲响钵声时，周围一片寂静。
Things were actually silent when she rang the bell.

1231
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,955
现在当她敲钵时，我们可能会
And now when she rings the bell, we could be like,

1232
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,457
大喊大叫，争吵不休，但我们仍然知道
yelling and stuff, and fighting, but we still know

1233
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,459
当钵声一响,
when that bell rings,

1234
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,585
我们就会停下来。
that we stop.

1236
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,224
到法院去吧，亚历克斯。
Go by the court, Alex.

1237
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,852
我没有和我的朋友谈论过正念。
I haven't talked about mindfulness with my friends.

1238
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,687
我和家人谈过了。
I talked about it with my family.

1239
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,857
我有一个哥哥。
I have one brother.

1240
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,696
我本来还有个哥哥，但他死了。
I woulda had another brother, but he died.

1241
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:44,035
我从他那里学会了如何打篮球。
I learned how to play basketball from him.

1242
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:50,375
我哥哥二十二岁。
My brother was twenty two.

1244
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,420
伙计，他说他会来吗？
So dude, he said he gonna come?

1245
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,255
不，他要我们去接他。
No, he want us to come and get him.

1246
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,173
他会和我们一起去音乐会吗？
Is he gonna come to concert with us?

1247
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,592
哥哥死后，他在学校发生了变化，
After his brother died, he changed in school,

1248
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,385
他的成绩下降了。
his grades went down.

1249
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:04,222
他的行为有点冷漠,
His behavior was kind of nonchalant,

1250
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,225
好像他什么都不在乎似的。
like he didn't really care about too much anything.

1251
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,103
等他长大一点,
And when he got a little older,

1252
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:13,773
就开始想找麻烦什么的了，对吧？
that's when you start trying to get in trouble and stuff, huh?

1254
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:14,566
是的。
Yeah.

1255
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,400
是的。
Yeah.

1256
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,069
这是我哥哥。
This is my brother.

1257
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:21,781
死于五年前。
He died five years ago.

1259
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,327
我问了很多人是否知道是谁干的。
I was asking a lot of people if they knew who did it.

1260
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,244
知道了吗？
Did you?

1261
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,370
是的。
Yeah.

1262
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,207
有些人知道是谁干的，有些人拒不回答。
Some people said yes, some people said no.

1263
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,543
不过我也无能为力。
Not like I could do something about it, though.

1264
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,377
是的。
Yeah.

1265
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:39,716
在他死后，然后其他几个
After he died, then a couple other people that you

1266
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,720
你认识和爱的人也死了，就这样,
knew and loved, died too, and so it was,

1267
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,805
你就开始真的发泄了。
you start really acting out.

1268
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,685
这是我另一个朋友，吉恩。
This is my other friend, Gene.

1269
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,772
他颈后中枪，
This is the one that got shot in the back of the neck

1270
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,690
一路跑到他奶奶家，
and ran all the way to his granny house

1271
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,275
死在了她的地板上。
and died on her floor.

1272
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,112
那是在新学年开始的时候。
That was in the beginning of the school year.

1273
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,449
你想他吗？
You miss him?

1274
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:04,866
是的。
Yeah.

1275
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:05,784
我也是。
I do, too.

1277
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,672
我们小时候经常去那里玩。
We used to play over there when we were little.

1278
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:19,631
那边是什么？
What was over there?

1279
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,132
就是空地。
Just open field.

1280
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,969
它大吗？
Was it bigger?

1281
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,097
那棵树阴森森的。
And the tree was so shady.

1282
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,642
他是不是就在门口被杀的？
Did he get killed like right there at the gate?

1283
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,645
有人走过来向他开枪。
And somebody had came up and shot him.

1284
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,439
见过了太多的死亡，然后你就会变得很沮丧,
Too much death and you get too depressed,

1285
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:40,026
有时候这里就像战区一样。
it's almost like a war zone sometimes out here.

1287
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,322
维尼曾经在那里吹过气球吗？
Vinnie used to heckle balloons over there?

1288
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,449
是的，气球，泰迪熊。
Yeah, balloons, teddy bears.

1289
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,742
然后发生了什么？
Then what happened?

1290
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:51,246
他们把这个门竖起来了，因为一开始这个门不在那里。
They put this gate up because at first the gate wasn't there.

1292
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,332
我正尽可能把精力放在学校和体育上，
I'm trying to focus on school and sports,

1293
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,583
基本上就是这样。
that's basically it.

1294
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,422
希望如果我继续运动,
And hopefully if I keep on playing sports,

1295
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,757
也许能让我离开这里。
that could probably get me out of here.

1296
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,759
我可以带着我的家人离开里士满。
I could take my family out of Richmond.

1297
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,845
我们会搬到别的地方。
We'd just move somewhere.

1298
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,054
是的，他们在这里长大，
Yeah, they grew up right here

1299
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,764
就像我在这个街区长大一样。
just like I grew up on this block.

1300
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:10,932
他们都死了。
They all dead.

1302
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:28,658
今天我能找个人来带领吗？
Alright, can I get somebody to lead today?

1303
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,243
你想试试吗，奥马尔？
Do you want to, Omar?

1304
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,871
奥马尔今天也参加了。
Omar was participating today.

1305
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,914
我是说，他参与的方式
I mean, he participates in a way that's also

1306
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,499
也是在制造点小麻烦。
making a little bit of trouble.

1307
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,126
他有自己的角色，
He has a certain role

1308
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:41,421
他下了点决心要扮演这个角色并参与进来。
and he's kind of determined to play the role and participate.

1310
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,506
他似乎正在努力做到这一点。
And he seems to be managing that.

1311
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,800
非常优雅。
Just very elegant.

1312
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,594
等等，你想说什么？
So hold on, what do you want to say?

1313
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,722
保持一个专注的姿势。
Get in a mindful posture.

1314
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,476
乌木。
Ebony.

1315
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,019
起来。
Get up.

1316
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,520
哦，你说的时候得友善点。
Oh, you have to be kind, though.

1317
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,688
好好说。
Say it in a nice way.

1318
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,648
乌木，你能坐起身来吗？
Ebony, can you please sit up?

1319
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:01,566
谢谢你。
Thank you.

1320
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,609
谢谢你。
Thank you.

1323
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:10,492
现在往下看，听听钵声，好吗？
Now look down, and listen to the bell, okay?

1324
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,327
闭上眼睛。
Keep your eyes closed.

1325
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,748
你现在感觉怎么样？
How do you feel right now?

1326
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,582
放松了。
Relaxed.

1327
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,333
放松了？
Relaxed?

1328
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,000
还有别的感觉吗？
Anything else?

1329
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,210
 我认为奥马尔已经
I think Omar's reaching a point 

1330
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,045
达到了认真对待正念的地步。
where he's taking mindfulness seriously.

1331
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,338
你喜欢在一群人面前吗？
Do you like being in front of a group?

1332
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,506
是的，没关系。
Yeah, it's alright.

1333
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:25,757
这很酷。
It's cool.

1334
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:27,276
他真的很善于反思，
He's really reflective, 

1334
00:56:27,276 --> 00:56:29,076
他会思考发生的事情，
he thinks about what happens, 

1335
00:56:29,076 --> 00:56:31,429
他能看清事情两方面的情况。
he's able to look at both sides.

1336
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,263
好的。
Alright.

1337
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,560
来吧，敲吧。
Go ahead, ring it.

1339
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,779
正念确实有点让我吃惊。
Mindfulness kind of did surprise me.

1340
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:53,118
我以为我永远不会用到它，但我用了。
I didn't think I was ever gonna use it but I did.

1341
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,412
请注意你现在的感觉。
Please notice how you're feeling right now.

1342
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,059
我们在外面的院子里，
We were outside in the yard, 

1343
00:57:00,059 --> 00:57:03,128
有个女孩让我很生气。
and then some girl just made me mad.

1344
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,672
她会像鲁比一样揍你。
She will beat your ass like Ruby.

1345
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:10,051
我就觉得要把她的头发
I just felt like pulling her hair out

1346
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,303
扯下来掉到地上，然后掐死她。
dropping to the floor and choke her.

1347
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:17,308
我用正念让自己平静下来，什么也不做。
And I used mindfulness to calm down and not do nothing.

1349
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:23,314
我高兴做了正念，因为若这样做会有不良后果的。
I like it, 'cause there's consequences for that.

1350
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:29,669
我感觉挺高兴的，因为我可以真正地进行思考，
I kind of feel happy 'cause I get to really think about things 

1351
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:35,493
不犯以后会后悔的错误。
and not make a mistake that I will regret doing later on.

1353
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,120
让开。
Move over.

1354
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,209
当我对学校里的其他孩子生气时,
When I get angry at other kids at school,

1355
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,670
我真的很擅长给他们难堪。
I'm really good at putting them at their spot.

1356
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,339
老色鬼。
Dirty old goat.

1357
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,008
哦，她没听见。
Oh, she didn't hear.

1358
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,844
我看到了杰奎琳可爱的一面,
I've seen the sweet side of Jacqueline,

1359
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:56,681
有时候我希望她能表现出来，但是
and I sometimes would like her to show it, but

1360
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,977
我猜她不想让任何人看到这一面。
I guess she doesn't really want anyone to see it.

1362
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,073
你想推我吗？
You trying to push me?

1363
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,120
如果我要为别人看到的杰奎琳
So if I was gonna write down words for the Jackie

1364
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,916
写下一些文字，我会想出什么词来呢？
that other people see, what words would I come up with?

1365
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,209
很好。
Nice.

1366
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,460
嗯哼。
Mm hmm.

1367
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,212
有意思。
Funny.

1368
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,505
嗯哼。
Mm hmm.

1369
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,882
他们看我的眼神好像我很刻薄。
They look at me like I'm mean.

1370
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,383
有时候他们觉得你刻薄？
Sometimes they see you as mean?

1371
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,510
是的。
Yes.

1372
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,260
那太可怕了。
That's awful.

1373
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,639
杰奎琳喜欢参与正念。
Jacqueline likes participating in mindfulness.

1374
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:41,017
我觉得她的参与度发生了变化。
I think that her engagement has shifted.

1376
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,061
你可以两者兼备，不是很有趣吗？
Isn't it interesting that you can be both?

1377
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,648
我希望她能开始对
I'm hoping that she starts to gain some perspective

1378
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,400
最近发生的与其她女孩的交往
on these incidents that are happening recently with

1379
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,736
并与她们争吵打架之类的事情有一些新的认识，
other girls and getting into fights and all this stuff

1380
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:54,697
并能为自己选择一条不同的道路。
and choose a different path for herself.

1381
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,533
内心的杰希长什么样？
What's the Jackie on the inside?

1382
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,784
害羞。
Shy.

1383
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,913
我不认为正念会改变我。
I don't think doing mindfulness changes me at all.

1384
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,957
你觉得有人知道你害羞吗？
Do you think anybody knows you're shy?

1385
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,375
没人。
No.

1386
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,335
你觉得正念怎样？
What about thoughtful?

1387
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,253
不咋样。
No.

1388
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,963
很无聊，就像,
It's boring, but like,

1389
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:14,259
如果我生气之类的，可以拿它作为一种工具。
I could use it as a tool if I'm mad or something.

1390
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,094
当人们觉得你刻薄的时候,
When people see you as mean,

1391
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,930
你觉得这是怎么回事？
what's that all about?

1392
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,018
因为我把他们推来推去，
'Cause I push them around and like

1393
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,230
我会打他们。
I hit them and stuff like that.

1394
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,232
所以你表现得很强硬。
So you kind of act tough.

1395
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,234
你就是这样的人吗？
Is that who you are?

1396
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,611
这就是你内心的一部分吗？
That is a little bit of who you are on the inside?

1397
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,988
好吧，我们先把它放一边。
Okay, let's put that there.

1398
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,824
你能坦诚相待真是太好了。
That's really good for you to be honest about that.

1399
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,826
内心也有点刻薄。
A little mean on the inside, too.

1400
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,744
是的。
Yeah.

1401
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,787
你能接受这一点吗？
You okay with that?

1402
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,623
是的。
Okay.

1403
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,542
你觉得这是从哪儿来的？
Where do you think that comes from?

1404
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,588
我不知道。
I don't know.

1405
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,339
她确实在使用正念，
She does use mindfulness,

1406
00:59:54,339 --> 00:59:57,093
我不知道她为什么不说，但她确实在用正念。
I don't know why she doesn't say it, but she does.

1407
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,638
她会遇到麻烦，我会帮她解决,
She would have problems and I would help her out,

1408
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:04,309
但有时候她会用正念帮助自己。
but sometimes she would just use mindfulness to help herself.

1410
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,561
你的电池快没电了。
Your battery is fucking low.

1412
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,319
早上好。
Good morning.

1413
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,822
大家能把椅子转向前面吗？
Can I get everybody to turn your chairs towards the front?

1414
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,824
再敲一次，引起他们的注意。
Ring it again to get their attention.

1416
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,662
早上好。
Good morning.

1417
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,248
自从我上周三见到你之后，如果你们记得使用正念，
Can you raise your hand if you remembered to use mindfulness

1418
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,710
请举个手。
since I saw you on Wednesday?

1419
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,629
好的，很多人都记得。
Okay, that's a lot.

1420
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:34,171
如果你愿意说你什么时候用过，
Can you keep your hand up 

1421
01:00:34,171 --> 01:00:37,383
可以举起你们的手。
if you're willing to say when you used it?

1422
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,345
杰奎琳。
Jacqueline.

1423
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,304
星期四。
Thursday.

1424
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,140
因为出了点状况。
'Cause there was a problem.

1425
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,725
你用了什么正念形式？
And what kind of mindfulness did you use?

1426
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,018
正念呼吸。
Breathing.

1427
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:50,313
你为什么决定用正念呼吸？
And why did you decide to use breathing?

1428
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,273
因为她让我冷静下来。
'Cause she told me to calm down.

1429
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:53,816
莱斯利和你在一起，
So Lesly was with you

1430
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,984
她让你冷静下来吗？
and she told you to calm down?

1431
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,818
嗯哼。
Mm hmm.

1432
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,446
有用吗? 有帮助吗? 有什么改变吗？
And did it work or help or change anything?

1433
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,572
嗯哼。
Mm hmm.

1434
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,201
你还有什么要说的吗？
Will you say anything more about it?

1435
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,078
没什么要说的了。
There's nothing else to say.

1436
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:05,995
好的。
Okay.

1437
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:08,998
我知道，好的。
I know, alright.

1438
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:12,459
当我在学校遇到问题时，
When I have problems at school, 

1439
01:01:12,459 --> 01:01:15,880
我根本不和我的父母说话，
I really don't talk to my parents,

1440
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,383
真的不和我妈妈说话。
not really my mom.

1441
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:21,844
我不觉得她能理解我。
I don't really feel like she can understand me.

1442
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:27,266
我爱我的父母，我很高兴有他们两个人。
I love my parents. I'm happy to have both of them.

1443
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,104
我是家里唯一的姐姐，唯一的女儿。
I am the only sister, the only daughter.

1444
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:34,649
和我的两个小弟弟在一起，我感到很孤独。
I feel lonely with the two little brothers I have.

1445
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:37,151
有时候我会生他们的气。
Sometimes I get mad at them.

1446
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,571
别往那边扔了。
Stop throwing it over there.

1448
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:48,955
我处理生气的方式就是，
The way I deal with getting mad is that I would just

1449
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,583
假装什么都没发生，把它藏在心里,
pretend nothing happens and keep it in me,

1450
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,335
永远不让任何人知道。
never let anybody know.

1451
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,838
在学校也一样。
Same thing at school.

1452
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,299
有人让我哭泣，没有人知道这一点,
Someone makes me cry and no one else knew about it,

1453
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,470
我会把它藏在心里，假装什么都没发生。
I would keep it to myself and pretend nothing happened.

1454
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,765
我真的没办法发泄出来。
I really have no way to let it out.

1455
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:12,228
我去的地方总是很吵。
It's always, like, loud everywhere I go.

1456
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,521
永远没有安静过。
It's never quiet.

1457
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,731
从来没有静过。
Never still.

1458
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:19,694
我们冥想的时候，总是很安静，
When we meditate it's always quiet

1459
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,821
我可以听到不同的声音，
and I get to listen to different sounds

1460
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:26,993
这对我来说真的很不一样。
and it's really different for me.

1462
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,499
我的家人对此很感兴趣，并且想要了解
My family would get interest and want to learn about

1463
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:36,586
正念课程以及我从中学到的东西。
the mindfulness class and what I've learned from it.

1464
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:45,136
要有耐心是很难的。
It's difficult to be patient.

1465
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:50,558
我明白如果她继续参加这个放松计划，
I understand that if she continues with this relaxation program

1466
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:54,145
会更平静，也会让周遭环境放松些。
it will be calmer and relax this environment a bit.

1467
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,859
我喜欢她参加这个项目。
I like that she's taking this program.

1468
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:03,821
这样我们就能从她身上学到一些东西。
So that we can learn something about it through her.

1469
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,667
我第二节课有美术课。
I have art class for second period.

1470
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:24,634
我喜欢画画，比如，我想画一些有关
I like to draw, like, if I want to draw something about

1471
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,637
旧金山的画作，我喜欢画建筑之类的东西。
San Francisco, I like draw the buildings and stuff.

1472
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,639
我也喜欢涂鸦艺术。
I like graffiti arts, too.

1473
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,182
一，二...
And one, two...

1474
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,143
不喜欢画苹果或之类的东西。
Not like drawing apples or nothing like that.

1475
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,020
我不喜欢那些东西。
I don't really like that.

1477
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,823
我到处画画是为了让自己在某种程度上更有才华。
I draw everywhere to make myself more talented in a way.

1478
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:54,789
通过涂鸦，我可以看到愤怒的情绪消失了，
With doing graffiti, I can see that the anger goes away

1479
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:58,835
他会要求有独处的时间作画。
and he will ask for time alone to do that.

1481
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,881
如果我练习,
If I practice,

1482
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,509
我可以像这里的人一样成为一名画家。
I could be a painter like people here.

1483
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,095
我和其他人一样有天赋，
I could have as much talent as anybody

1484
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,556
我只需要坚持下去。
but I just need to keep at it.

1485
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:16,936
我画画的时候实际上不需要用到正念,
I don't really need to use mindfulness when I draw,

1486
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,397
但它给了我一点动力，正念会帮助我
but like, it gives me a little boost to try to help me

1487
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,733
集中注意力，看看我到底想画什么。
concentrate and try to see what I wanna draw.

1488
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:30,199
等我长大了，如果我可以把画画当副业,
When I grow up, if I can paint or draw as a side job,

1489
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,367
那就太酷了。
then that would be cool.

1490
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,161
如果我能把它做成一份可靠的工作,
And if I could do it as a solid, solid job,

1491
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,914
那么我会，是的，我肯定会这么做。
then I would, yeah, I would definitely do that.

1492
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,417
这样很好。
This is nice.

1493
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:45,339
我想，我确实有可能在七年级挂科。
I think it's true that I'm in danger of failing seventh grade.

1495
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:47,425
这并不意味着我就会放弃。
It doesn't mean that I'm gonna just quit.

1496
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:50,261
这意味着我要更努力通过测验。
It means that I'm gonna try harder to pass.

1497
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,806
埃恩勒先生，
Mister Ehnle,

1498
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:57,935
我想知道你们班有没有在我不在场时
I wanted to know if you as a class have ever done

1499
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,478
做过正念练习？
mindfulness without me?

1500
01:04:59,478 --> 01:04:59,979
做过。
Yes.

1501
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:00,438
没有。
No.

1502
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,397
我们没有做。
We have not.

1503
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,356
好的,
Okay,

1504
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,443
我想知道你们有没有钵？
I wondered if you had a bell?

1505
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:08,321
最能持续正念的班级,
The classes that best sustain mindfulness,

1506
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,698
老师和学生即使在正念课程结束后
the teachers and the students continue to use the bell

1507
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,199
也会继续使用钵，
even when the program is finished,

1508
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:15,494
这样在教室里就有了个固定的工具，
so that there's this constant tool in the classroom

1509
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,162
它会给正念练习一个提醒，
to give a reminder of mindfulness and 

1510
01:05:17,162 --> 01:05:19,206
引导大家进行正念练习。
to facilitate a mindful practice.

1512
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:39,226
为了让同学们平静下来，重新集中注意力,
In terms of calming things down, refocusing,

1513
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,938
正念是值得在课堂上花时间学习的。
mindfulness was worth the class time.

1514
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,273
这一点毋庸置疑。
No doubt about that.

1515
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,566
正念让学生们觉得
It makes them feel

1516
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,235
自己对自己和自己的行为
like thy have more control over themselves

1517
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,988
有更多的掌控权，而不是
and their behavior and that they aren't simply

1518
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:52,865
外部环境的受害者。
victims of external circumstances.

1519
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,993
现在我们来看看数学。
So, now we're going to look at some math.

1520
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:58,663
圆的面积等于
The volume of a circle,

1521
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:01,082
π 乘以半径的平方。
Pi times radius squared.

1522
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:03,042
在练习正念之前，我有点像,
Before mindfulness, I would just be like,

1523
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:06,629
不知道该做什么，不注意任何事情。
not knowing what to do, not paying attention to anything.

1524
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,507
而现在，当我需要坐下来工作时，
And like now, when I need to sit down and do my work,

1525
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:13,177
我只是想一下，然后对自己说，你必须这么做。
I just think about it and like, say, you gotta do this, you know?

1527
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,595
这是什么词？
What word is this?

1528
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,596
Though.

1529
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:16,430
Though.

1530
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,059
我觉得他们对自己的所作所为感觉好多了。
I think they feel better about what they're doing.

1531
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,894
他们更有自信。
They have more self-confidence.

1532
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,604
他们注意力更集中了。
They're paying attention better.

1533
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:27,566
他们觉得自己上课更专注了。
That they feel more engaged in the lessons.

1534
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,152
好的，非常好。
Okay, very good.

1535
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,488
我的性格变了。
My personality changed.

1536
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,240
因为如果想之前一样有冲突,
'Cause if there was a conflict before,

1537
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,658
我可能已经准备好要吵架了。
I would probably be ready to fight.

1538
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:41,205
但现在我会更多地对自己说，放松、冷静。
But now I'm just like, more, laid back, calm.

1540
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:45,751
我们取一条对称线。
We take a line of symmetry and then.

1541
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,837
教师的角色已经扩大了。
The role of the teacher has expanded.

1542
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,464
我们面临的最大挑战是
The biggest challenge that we have is

1543
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,383
改变这些学校建筑内的系统和结构，
changing our systems and structures within these

1544
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:55,052
这样孩子们才能融入学校。
school buildings so the kids can fit in.

1545
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,513
如果你去看看帮助学生
If you go and look at database indicators 

1546
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:58,556
学习的数据库指标，
that help students learn,

1547
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,976
自我反省的行为在这个名单上排名靠前,
self-reflective behavior is way up on that list,

1548
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:04,353
这也是我们很多优秀的学习者
and that's one of the things that many of our good learners

1549
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,773
会带到学校而其他人没有带来的东西。
bring that others don't bring to the school.

1550
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:10,609
因此，像这样一个帮助教导孩子们的项目，
And so a program like this that helps teach kids that,

1551
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,529
并帮助它成为学校实践的一部分，
and helps it become a part of the practice within the school

1552
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:16,615
强化这一点的话，将帮助到这些孩子们。
and reinforces that is going to help them.

1553
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,122
整幅壁画,
The whole mural,

1554
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,833
是关于我们如何在城市中有更多的和平。
it's about how we need more peace in the city.

1555
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,755
制作这件作品最棒的环节
The best part of making this piece

1556
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:33,632
是和其他人一起工作。
was working with other people.

1557
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,385
我觉得正念教会了我如何冷静下来,
I think mindfulness taught me how to calm down,

1558
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,430
尽量不把问题挡在事情的发展道路上，
to try to not put problems in the way of stuff

1559
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,891
而真正选择我想要的想法，
and choose what I want to think

1560
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,642
选择我想要的感觉。
and choose how I want to feel.

1561
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:45,978
我可以在上涂抹吗？
Should I paint over it?

1562
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,355
好啊，再涂一层白色？
Yeah, and then maybe a layer of white?

1563
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:50,399
好的，我知道，在它上面涂抹。
Yeah, I know, paint over it.

1564
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,985
其他老师告诉我，他做不成事,
The other teachers that tell me he can't do good,

1565
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,612
他只会捣乱，你知道吗？
all he does is disrupt, you know?

1566
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,522
最后有人说，
It's like finally somebody's saying 

1567
01:07:56,522 --> 01:07:58,154
他们对我的工作印象深刻，
that they're impressed on what I do

1568
01:07:58,154 --> 01:08:00,201
他们很高兴我在那里作画。
and that they're happy that I'm there.

1569
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:02,374
这让我感觉很好，
It makes me feel good, 

1570
01:08:02,374 --> 01:08:05,289
让我觉得，我知道我可以好好作画。
makes me feel like I know I could do it.

1571
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:13,130
好了，今天是我们正念课程的最后一天。
Okay, so today is our last day of mindfulness.

1573
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,340
不！
No!

1575
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,554
马特？
Matt?

1576
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:25,101
如果你们有什么反应或者想说什么,
So, if you have a reaction, or something to say,

1577
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,978
我希望你们只去注意到自己的反应。
I want you to just notice it in yourself.

1578
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,564
如果你们无法控制自己的冲动,
If you can not control your impulse,

1579
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:34,777
你们得问问自己，是谁在控制？
you have to ask yourself, who's in control?

1580
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:43,494
我想请你们闭上眼睛或低下头。
I'm gonna ask you to keep your eyes closed or down.

1581
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:46,205
我想让你注意到移动眼睛，
So I want you to notice the impulse to move your eyes

1582
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:48,165
或移动身体，或想说话的冲动。
or move your body or talk.

1584
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:52,128
真正尝试容纳这种冲动，以便你能控制，
And really try to contain that so that you are in control,

1585
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,587
不是...东西
not something...

1586
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:55,881
正念并不能使问题消失。
Mindfulness doesn't make problems go away.

1587
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,425
认为如果你长期练习，那么你就不会再生气，
It's a wrong assumption to think that if you

1588
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:00,803
或者你就不会再有问题，或者没有人会对你生气，
practice for a long time, then you'll never be angry again,

1589
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,333
或者你再也不会有麻烦了，
or you'll never have another problem 

1590
01:09:02,333 --> 01:09:04,348
或者没人会对你生气。
or no one will ever be mad at you.

1591
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:05,766
这根本不是重点,
That's not the point at all,

1592
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:08,769
你永远无法创造这种情况。
and you can never create that situation.

1593
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:11,856
关键是你满足你经历的方式发生了变化，
It's that the way you're meeting your experience changes

1594
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:16,235
允许更多的轻松和更多的幸福来满足情况。
to allow more lightness and more happiness to meet situations.

1596
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,571
只关注你自己,
Just focusing on yourself,

1597
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,824
并尊重你周围的人,
and respecting the people around you,

1598
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,869
我们将听到钵声。
and we'll listen to the sound of the bell.

1600
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,455
注意到让你分心的东西,
Noticing what distracts you,

1601
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:31,292
如果你能集中注意力两分钟。
and if you can stay focused for two minutes.

1602
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,548
我不知道为什么我这么容易分心。
I don't know why I get distracted really easily.

1603
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,300
有时我也会偷懒。
Sometimes I get lazy.

1604
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,387
我必须坐在远离朋友的地方，
I'm gonna have to sit away from my friends

1605
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:47,099
控制自己，做好自己的工作，不偷懒。
and control myself, do my work and not get lazy.

1606
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,728
我今天给你们带了点东西。
I did bring something for you today.

1607
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,064
马特，你想说点什么吗？
Matt, do you want to say something?

1608
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:54,565
是的。
Yes.

1609
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:55,065
好的。
Okay.

1610
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:56,567
是葡萄干吗？
Is it raisins?

1611
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:56,984
不是。
No.

1612
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,027
是葡萄干麦麸吗？
Is it raisin bran?

1613
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:58,569
不是。
No.

1615
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,031
我将在以后使用正念。
I will use mindfulness in the future.

1616
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,533
我现在觉得这是理所当然的。
I think I kind of take it for granted now.

1617
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,743
梅根来了，
Megan comes in

1618
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:08,996
像对我们说，你们可以放松一下。
and it's like, you get to relax.

1619
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,415
往后,
Later on,

1620
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:14,001
也许一两年后,
maybe a year from now or two,

1621
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,005
我想我会更多地使用正念。
I think I'll use mindfulness more.

1622
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,842
这叫袖珍心形。
They're called pocket hearts.

1623
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:26,138
无论你看到它，感觉到它，还是记得它,
Whenever you see it or feel it or remember it,

1624
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,098
我希望它是个能提醒你的东西，
I want it to be something that reminds you that

1625
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:32,436
你现在有一个工具，你可以在往后余生使用正念。
you have a tool now that you can use for the rest of your life.

1627
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,943
看到我爸的工作方式，我感觉他压力很大。
Seeing how my dad works, like, it's stressful.

1628
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,570
如果我有压力的话，我会用正念的。
I think I would want to use it if I was stressed.

1629
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,113
正念就像你背包里的东西,
It's like something in your backpack,

1630
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:45,491
它一直都在那里，你可以把它拿出来，然后使用它。
it's always there and you can just pull it out and use it.

1632
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:50,788
一旦你有了这个袖珍心形,
Once you have your heart,

1633
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:51,830
我想让你至少想
I want you to think about

1634
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,375
一件你学到了的东西。
at least one thing that you've learned.

1635
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:57,753
我被坐在我旁边的许多人分散了注意力。
I get distracted by many people who are sitting beside me.

1636
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,504
他们会开始取笑我，
They're gonna start teasing me 

1637
01:10:59,504 --> 01:11:01,131
并对我不断进行骚扰。
and bothering me about everything.

1638
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:03,843
我只是喜欢去一个私人的地方，
I just like going to a private place and 

1639
01:11:03,843 --> 01:11:06,679
说出我内心所有的想法，我的感受。
saying all my thoughts inside of me, what I feel.

1640
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,932
没人能看到我做的任何事。
Nobody is there to look and see anything that I do.

1641
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:13,978
有人能说说如果每个人
Can anybody say how school would be different

1642
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,854
都练习正念，学校会有什么不同吗？
if everybody practiced mindfulness?

1643
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:16,689
谁来说说？
Yeah?

1644
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:17,523
没有欺凌。
No bullying.

1645
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,524
没有欺凌，是的。
No bullying, yeah.

1646
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,151
你为什么认为这样就不会发生欺凌事件呢？
Why do you think that would make no bullying happen?

1647
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:23,693
因为很多人都受到了
Because many people have been getting hurt 

1648
01:11:23,693 --> 01:11:25,572
别人的伤害。
by people picking on them.

1649
01:11:25,572 --> 01:11:28,158
好的，谢谢。
Yeah, thank you.

1650
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:29,994
如果全世界都用正念，
It'll make a difference

1651
01:11:29,994 --> 01:11:31,912
整个世界都会大变样。
if the whole world used mindfulness.

1652
01:11:31,912 --> 01:11:33,789
很多人就不会被杀了。
A lot of people wouldn't be killed.

1653
01:11:33,789 --> 01:11:35,874
射击会减少。
It would be less shooting.

1654
01:11:38,752 --> 01:11:41,797
好了，各位，祝你们暑假快乐。
Alright everybody, I wish you a happy summer.

1655
01:11:41,797 --> 01:11:44,300
明年我可能见不到你们，祝大家八年级快乐。
And if I don't see you next year, happy eighth grade.
