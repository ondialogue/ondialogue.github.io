1
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,141
First word, part one.

2
00:00:16,141 --> 00:00:17,559
What sound?

3
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:18,685
[Student] E.

4
00:00:18,685 --> 00:00:19,561
What word?

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,395
[Student] Pure.

6
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:21,312
Good, next word, what sound?

7
00:00:21,312 --> 00:00:22,272
[Student] E.

8
00:00:22,272 --> 00:00:23,481
What word?

9
00:00:23,481 --> 00:00:24,315
Gerard?

10
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,358
Are you with us?

11
00:00:25,358 --> 00:00:26,192
What word?

12
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,027
[Student] School.

13
00:00:27,027 --> 00:00:28,111
Okay, part two.

14
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:29,487
What sound?

15
00:00:29,487 --> 00:00:32,240
(bell ringing)

16
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,243
(students laughing)

17
00:00:36,703 --> 00:00:40,415
♪ First bell rings I hate that sound ♪

18
00:00:40,415 --> 00:00:44,002
♪ Back of the class with my head down ♪

19
00:00:44,002 --> 00:00:47,839
♪ Got a test, all kinds of stress ♪

20
00:00:47,839 --> 00:00:50,800
♪ Can't take home another F ♪

21
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,510
♪ Sometimes I need to stop ♪

22
00:00:52,510 --> 00:00:54,596
♪ And breathe ♪

23
00:00:54,596 --> 00:00:57,348
(girls laughing)

24
00:01:04,731 --> 00:01:07,150
Alright, time to ring the bell.

25
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,361
(bell rings)

26
00:01:10,361 --> 00:01:12,530
Okay, partner up everybody.

27
00:01:13,156 --> 00:01:16,451
My name is Ling Busche, I'm a seventh grade counselor

28
00:01:16,451 --> 00:01:17,744
at Marina Middle School.

29
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,662
You gotta go to the end of the line.

30
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,663
Nice try, Deshaun.

31
00:01:20,663 --> 00:01:22,624
We're one of the larger middle schools.

32
00:01:22,624 --> 00:01:25,210
We have a student population of about

33
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:26,795
nine hundred.

34
00:01:26,795 --> 00:01:28,963
Line is going pretty smooth today.

35
00:01:28,963 --> 00:01:30,340
There is a great divide

36
00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:33,093
in terms of student population.

37
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:35,720
Guys, let's go inside.

38
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:38,139
You've got the honors classes that

39
00:01:38,139 --> 00:01:40,308
have the highest performing students,

40
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:41,643
no behavior problems.

41
00:01:41,643 --> 00:01:44,521
Then you have the general ed classes, which are a mix,

42
00:01:44,521 --> 00:01:48,108
but contain students who have the lowest test scores.

43
00:01:50,819 --> 00:01:54,364
I virtually get no behavioral referrals for the

44
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,949
honors classes.

45
00:01:55,949 --> 00:01:58,034
All of the disciplinary referrals are coming out of

46
00:01:58,034 --> 00:01:59,619
the general ed classes.

47
00:02:00,578 --> 00:02:03,581
(children chatting)

48
00:02:05,667 --> 00:02:08,503
We do haves students who seem well-served,

49
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:12,173
who are successful, who perform well and

50
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:16,344
within our very same campus, we have a group of students who

51
00:02:16,344 --> 00:02:19,264
are completely disconnected and disengaged.

52
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:23,184
There is a significant number of our students

53
00:02:23,184 --> 00:02:26,229
that don't see school as a place for them.

54
00:02:26,229 --> 00:02:29,023
I always say it by saying,
"they don't do school."

55
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:29,858
Diego.

56
00:02:31,568 --> 00:02:35,029
One disruptive kid can take away any learning

57
00:02:35,029 --> 00:02:36,573
that goes on in the class.

58
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:39,742
(students laughing)

59
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,036
So other kids wanna misbehave because they think

60
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:43,413
everybody's misbehaving.

61
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,540
Shut up, you cricket.

62
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,708
(students laughing)

63
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,876
Fat mama.

64
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:52,297
Ooh.

65
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:55,717
When the class is crazy, and throwing pencils,

66
00:02:55,717 --> 00:02:57,969
it messes up my concentration fully.

67
00:02:57,969 --> 00:03:01,723
So the thing I do is I just sit in my chair and do nothing.

68
00:03:01,723 --> 00:03:03,016
Chris?

69
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,893
Turn around, get on task.

70
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:08,062
I have sent out and suspended from my classroom

71
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:10,315
more students than I have in a long time.

72
00:03:10,315 --> 00:03:11,649
You're gonna get me in trouble.

73
00:03:11,649 --> 00:03:15,153
I just find the behavior to be completely off the wall

74
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:18,448
and unacceptable, not just toward me, but toward each other.

75
00:03:20,241 --> 00:03:22,577
A lot of kids might not feel that

76
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:25,622
school is always relevant to them.

77
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:29,542
School is structured for a certain type of kid,

78
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:32,629
and maybe they're not that type of kid.

79
00:03:32,629 --> 00:03:35,465
It reaches a point where they don't feel like they're heard.

80
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:40,178
Number ten to forty,

81
00:03:41,095 --> 00:03:42,096
even.

82
00:03:42,096 --> 00:03:43,848
This was the assignment yesterday.

83
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,101
[Ling] When you visit Mister Ehnle's class,

84
00:03:47,101 --> 00:03:49,270
it feels very chaotic in there.

85
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:50,438
What is going on with you two?

86
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:52,273
Get out a piece of paper.

87
00:03:52,273 --> 00:03:53,107
Science.

88
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:55,985
Science.

89
00:03:55,985 --> 00:03:58,238
[Ling] There's sort of this sense of

90
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,614
nonstop entertainment,

91
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,741
and whatever's happening in the lesson

92
00:04:01,741 --> 00:04:03,409
often becomes secondary.

93
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:06,788
Do not misspell the word amphibian.

94
00:04:06,788 --> 00:04:07,622
Anyways,

95
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:10,458
I forgot what I was saying.

96
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,961
[Ling] Their engagement is tied to

97
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:15,964
the drama that's happening in the yard,

98
00:04:15,964 --> 00:04:17,924
what's happening on Facebook,

99
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:22,512
and they are consumed by it and so it just continues on

100
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,638
in the classroom.

101
00:04:28,142 --> 00:04:29,310
[Student] Stop kicking me.

102
00:04:30,228 --> 00:04:33,064
Did you see what this freaking whale just did?

103
00:04:33,064 --> 00:04:36,067
(students laughing)

104
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,530
That's your backpack?

105
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:41,322
Yep.

106
00:04:41,364 --> 00:04:42,240
Excuse me?

107
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,533
It's my backpack.

108
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:45,910
[Student] That's Connor's backpack.

109
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:46,995
Jeanette.

110
00:04:50,832 --> 00:04:52,458
Jeanette, leave the room.

111
00:04:53,167 --> 00:04:54,419
I'd go back out with Edwin.

112
00:04:54,419 --> 00:04:56,004
[Ehnle] Slope is M.

113
00:04:56,004 --> 00:04:58,423
We're going to take a Y value.

114
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,591
[Student] He be hanging out with Tiara a lot

115
00:05:00,591 --> 00:05:02,719
on the bus, he always be sitting with her.

116
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:04,679
I know, but they broke up.

117
00:05:04,679 --> 00:05:06,514
Well, she broke up with him.

118
00:05:06,556 --> 00:05:08,266
Excuse me, if I continue

119
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:10,643
to hear talking, one or both of you are gonna find

120
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,020
a new seat.

121
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:13,146
[Student] Ugh.

122
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,856
No, that's not ugh.

123
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:16,899
It's yes, Mister Ehnle, then you get on task.

124
00:05:17,608 --> 00:05:20,361
With that many bodies in a classroom,

125
00:05:20,361 --> 00:05:22,530
when somebody needs to be moved off to a corner,

126
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:25,199
there are no corners, 'cause there's already somebody there.

127
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,034
I've given up.

128
00:05:26,034 --> 00:05:27,452
I just put 'em next to each other.

129
00:05:27,452 --> 00:05:29,078
'Cause I'd rather have them talking and yelling and

130
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,748
carrying on next to each other than across the room.

131
00:05:32,707 --> 00:05:33,708
Think about it.

132
00:05:33,708 --> 00:05:34,751
Lately,

133
00:05:35,543 --> 00:05:39,630
we would all learn much more if nobody really was talking

134
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:41,341
or getting distracted.

135
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:44,218
We would all, like, have our grades up,

136
00:05:44,218 --> 00:05:46,929
we would all be good kids and everything.

137
00:05:46,929 --> 00:05:49,182
I know we're good kids, we're smart,

138
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:50,224
but sometimes,

139
00:05:51,309 --> 00:05:53,394
I guess we're too lazy to show it.

140
00:05:54,228 --> 00:05:56,647
Okay, you have one minute to finish your spelling

141
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:58,066
and then you need to get a purple book

142
00:05:58,066 --> 00:05:59,525
that's right in front of you.

143
00:06:01,402 --> 00:06:02,945
You stupid bitch.

144
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:05,823
That's why nobody likes your ugly ass.

145
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,408
No one likes you.

146
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:09,577
[Miss Illes] Gerardo, keep going, you're doing it.

147
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:12,413
[Ling] Gerardo does get angry sometimes

148
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:15,917
and seek out a challenge with his teachers.

149
00:06:16,834 --> 00:06:20,463
He basically shows up and

150
00:06:20,463 --> 00:06:22,590
produces very little work.

151
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:25,343
It has really brought him down

152
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,969
in terms of his academic performance.

153
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:28,513
I'm not the only one that fools around.

154
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:29,138
[Gerardo] Yeah you are.

155
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,056
No, I'm not.

156
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:33,267
Shut up, we're gonna get fucking zeroes.

157
00:06:33,309 --> 00:06:36,521
If I get frustrated, I get hot and then after,

158
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:39,315
I get cold, all the heat goes away.

159
00:06:39,315 --> 00:06:40,858
I just finished all my work.

160
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:43,111
It's not a good feeling that I have.

161
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,072
Could you stop writing on my work?

162
00:06:46,072 --> 00:06:46,781
Please?

163
00:06:47,782 --> 00:06:49,283
Middle school boys have trouble

164
00:06:49,283 --> 00:06:53,496
sitting still for long periods of time and focusing

165
00:06:53,496 --> 00:06:55,164
at their desks.

166
00:06:55,164 --> 00:06:57,291
This really doesn't work for them in general,

167
00:06:57,291 --> 00:06:58,459
but that's the way school looks.

168
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,002
That's how it's structured.

169
00:07:00,002 --> 00:07:02,672
Open your books, please, to lesson 15.

170
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,757
First word, what word?

171
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:06,134
I already did it.

172
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,051
[Mister Ehnle] Omar?

173
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:09,220
Omar, when the teacher says read the first word,

174
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:10,054
that's what you do.

175
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:11,472
I read the first word.

176
00:07:11,472 --> 00:07:12,390
[Mister Ehnle] On cue.

177
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,143
Mister Ehnle's class is a jungle.

178
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:18,688
Everyday somebody gets sent out.

179
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:21,482
Always it's wild in there, everybody's out of their seat,

180
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:22,316
just around.

181
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,737
It makes it hard for me to focus 'cause I get distracted.

182
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:28,072
It makes it hard to learn.

183
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:29,073
[Mister Ehnle] So let's reconvene.

184
00:07:29,073 --> 00:07:29,782
Malik?

185
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,242
Go sit over there by Jacqueline.

186
00:07:31,242 --> 00:07:32,326
[Jacqueline] No.

187
00:07:33,536 --> 00:07:35,621
I really fear for these kids who

188
00:07:35,621 --> 00:07:37,165
don't put forth the effort.

189
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:38,166
They don't try.

190
00:07:38,166 --> 00:07:40,001
They don't persevere.

191
00:07:40,001 --> 00:07:40,835
Next word.

192
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:43,421
Next word, what sound?

193
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,255
What word?

194
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:46,132
Good, next word.

195
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,008
What sound?

196
00:07:47,008 --> 00:07:49,135
How can you put together a relationship,

197
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:52,680
how can you stay at a job when it's not fun

198
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:55,183
if you have not learned to persevere?

199
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,934
What is it that you?

200
00:07:56,934 --> 00:07:57,935
I'm not reading.

201
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,980
You're not gonna help yourself be successful

202
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:02,690
when you're behaving like this.

203
00:08:03,983 --> 00:08:04,817
Omar?

204
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,860
What?

205
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:07,612
This is not the way to help yourself be successful.

206
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:09,113
[Omar Voiceover] I do like learning new stuff,

207
00:08:09,113 --> 00:08:11,157
but if they're teaching it in a difficult way

208
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:14,577
that I don't understand, then I'm just gonna stop trying.

209
00:08:14,619 --> 00:08:15,411
You know what?

210
00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,746
I don't wanna hear any arguing.

211
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:18,623
I know I could do better.

212
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:20,541
If I just turned in my homework.

213
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,794
Tonight's homework for science is twelve dash three.

214
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:24,754
(girls laughing)

215
00:08:24,754 --> 00:08:27,006
Jacqueline, go sit in the back.

216
00:08:27,006 --> 00:08:27,423
Ugh.

217
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,051
No, it's not smacking your lips, it's go sit in the back.

218
00:08:30,218 --> 00:08:32,929
Mister Ehnle does disrespect me.

219
00:08:33,846 --> 00:08:35,765
He has an island on his head.

220
00:08:35,765 --> 00:08:38,142
He dresses weird.

221
00:08:38,142 --> 00:08:40,061
He has huge

222
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:41,395
glasses.

223
00:08:42,396 --> 00:08:43,940
And he screams a lot.

224
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,149
No, you're next to Gerardo.

225
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:47,276
No, I'm next to Lesly.

226
00:08:47,276 --> 00:08:49,570
You're wasting not only your time,

227
00:08:50,321 --> 00:08:52,657
the sad part is you're wasting others' time.

228
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,325
I wanna know what the text is.

229
00:08:55,743 --> 00:08:58,079
When are you gonna have it again?

230
00:08:58,162 --> 00:09:00,414
Jacqueline, if you are having a conversation,

231
00:09:00,414 --> 00:09:03,167
it will end or you will be out of the classroom.

232
00:09:03,167 --> 00:09:05,253
Why do you always send me out of the classroom?

233
00:09:05,294 --> 00:09:05,920
Huh?

234
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,256
Because you do so much talking.

235
00:09:08,256 --> 00:09:10,758
He's assuming that I'm always the one that's

236
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:12,134
starting the problems.

237
00:09:12,134 --> 00:09:13,427
It makes me feel mad.

238
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,596
[Mister Ehnle]
Jacqueline, get your stuff

239
00:09:15,596 --> 00:09:17,056
and go see Nick.

240
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:21,852
[Ling Busche] When the teachers have tried

241
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:25,022
things in the classroom, then the student comes down

242
00:09:25,022 --> 00:09:26,190
with the referral.

243
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:32,071
[Jacqueline] When we get kicked out,

244
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,781
we go down to the office.

245
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,827
I'm always the one that he sends out.

246
00:09:37,827 --> 00:09:39,120
It always feels bad.

247
00:09:41,622 --> 00:09:44,584
Sometimes, they get pigeonholed because of,

248
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,877
you know, previous patterns of behavior.

249
00:09:48,629 --> 00:09:49,630
I think that they

250
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:51,465
all feel like the underdogs.

251
00:09:51,465 --> 00:09:53,050
No one's rooting for them.

252
00:09:54,051 --> 00:09:56,637
(somber music)

253
00:10:06,897 --> 00:10:08,733
Gerardo, when you get sent down,

254
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:11,652
nine times out of ten it's because of something like,

255
00:10:11,652 --> 00:10:13,321
which seems small, like an argument.

256
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:15,448
She's like you have a history of doing stuff

257
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:17,742
and I said but I'm not doing what I used to back,

258
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:20,036
back in sixth grade or nothing.

259
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:23,164
A lot of the students that come in and out of the office,

260
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:27,335
ironically, sometimes it feels like they

261
00:10:28,044 --> 00:10:29,837
want to come to the counseling office,

262
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,173
which is a little bit of a dilemma because

263
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,675
they're outside of the classroom more.

264
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,469
And it's, like, not fair.

265
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:38,846
If it all boils down to it, you're messing yourself up

266
00:10:38,846 --> 00:10:39,930
because.

267
00:10:39,930 --> 00:10:41,349
But if I'm not doing nothing,

268
00:10:41,349 --> 00:10:42,933
how am I messing myself up?

269
00:10:42,933 --> 00:10:43,851
How am I, how am I,

270
00:10:43,851 --> 00:10:46,228
how am I the one that's putting myself into this

271
00:10:46,228 --> 00:10:47,271
when I'm not doing nothing?

272
00:10:47,271 --> 00:10:48,481
You're missing your test,

273
00:10:48,481 --> 00:10:51,859
so now it's gonna be kind of a hassle to get you

274
00:10:51,859 --> 00:10:53,235
to make up that test.

275
00:10:53,235 --> 00:10:54,612
It all adds up.

276
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:56,280
But I didn't do anything.

277
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:56,822
[Ling] Nothing?

278
00:10:56,822 --> 00:10:57,531
Nothing.

279
00:10:57,531 --> 00:10:58,366
When you're in the moment

280
00:10:58,366 --> 00:11:00,868
and you're in front of the class, things get

281
00:11:00,868 --> 00:11:01,369
heated,

282
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:03,496
they become, you know, the problem becomes escalated.

283
00:11:03,537 --> 00:11:05,539
I want my mom to come and talk some sense into that lady.

284
00:11:05,581 --> 00:11:06,957
[Ling] Okay, well she can be part of that, too.

285
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:08,292
[Gerardo] I swear, she just.

286
00:11:08,292 --> 00:11:09,710
We have a consultant that

287
00:11:09,710 --> 00:11:12,088
came in recently, and she

288
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:14,632
actually described our school as apartheid-land,

289
00:11:14,632 --> 00:11:18,386
which, I was at first a little bit offended by, but

290
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:22,515
after thinking about it, I understood what she meant.

291
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:26,977
Because she saw who was coming in and out of

292
00:11:26,977 --> 00:11:28,396
the counseling office.

293
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:30,940
I don't want to see you in here with another referral today,

294
00:11:30,981 --> 00:11:31,649
Gerardo.

295
00:11:31,691 --> 00:11:32,191
Alright.

296
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:32,900
[Ling] Get it together.

297
00:11:32,942 --> 00:11:35,069
It's our Latino and African American kids

298
00:11:35,069 --> 00:11:37,530
who are underachieving, who don't feel like they're part of

299
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:39,198
the school and

300
00:11:39,198 --> 00:11:42,076
we have to address that, we have to make those kids

301
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,662
part of the school and we have to allow those students

302
00:11:44,662 --> 00:11:47,206
the opportunities and, in fact, get them to achieve

303
00:11:47,206 --> 00:11:48,416
at a higher level.

304
00:11:48,416 --> 00:11:50,501
Hey, Chris, why don't you just come into my office

305
00:11:50,501 --> 00:11:52,920
and I'm gonna clear off that little table for you?

306
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,800
Something that would benefit all of the kids had to happen

307
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,759
across

308
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,803
all of the students.

309
00:12:00,803 --> 00:12:03,931
So when one of our therapists talked about the idea

310
00:12:03,931 --> 00:12:06,058
of going into the classroom to teach

311
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:08,686
meditative strategies which would

312
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,730
reduce conflict,

313
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,275
increase focus, you know, we were like, that's perfect.

314
00:12:15,985 --> 00:12:17,278
Moises?

315
00:12:17,278 --> 00:12:18,112
[Moises] Yes.

316
00:12:18,154 --> 00:12:19,405
Why are you out of class, buddy?

317
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:21,365
I went to get groceries.

318
00:12:21,365 --> 00:12:22,283
[Principal] We are suspending

319
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,118
at a rate higher than any other

320
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,661
middle school in this city.

321
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:28,247
And I know that that has to stop.

322
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,624
(somber music)

323
00:12:30,624 --> 00:12:33,586
What we'd like to do is create a sense of

324
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,672
this is a community, and we're not just gonna push you out.

325
00:12:36,672 --> 00:12:39,133
We're gonna help teach you about how to do this

326
00:12:39,133 --> 00:12:39,967
and do it well.

327
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:42,303
So we're gonna look and see where you are at in the process,

328
00:12:42,303 --> 00:12:44,638
how many times this has happened with you.

329
00:12:44,638 --> 00:12:45,848
[Omar] It's only happened once.

330
00:12:45,848 --> 00:12:48,309
She says there was a sixth grade incident, though, so.

331
00:12:48,309 --> 00:12:50,853
So one of the reasons that we embraced bringing in

332
00:12:50,853 --> 00:12:53,856
mindfulness into the classroom was to say if we could create

333
00:12:53,856 --> 00:12:57,067
a bright light within the community, where adults and

334
00:12:57,067 --> 00:13:00,237
children can see that, hey, something is really working

335
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:04,658
to make this community more inclusive and for everybody,

336
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,494
if we can start creating those spots around

337
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:09,413
Marina Middle School, then others will see it and start to

338
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:10,664
adopt that

339
00:13:10,664 --> 00:13:13,000
empathetic and that attitude of saying that the school

340
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:15,169
is gonna meet more of those needs.

341
00:13:15,169 --> 00:13:18,214
(quiet string music)

342
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,012
My name is Megan Cowan,

343
00:13:25,721 --> 00:13:30,059
and I am here from an organization called Mindful Schools.

344
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,644
We go into classrooms

345
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:34,522
and teach something called mindfulness.

346
00:13:34,522 --> 00:13:36,732
I'm gonna be visiting your classroom

347
00:13:36,732 --> 00:13:39,193
twice a week for just 20,

348
00:13:39,193 --> 00:13:41,195
maybe 30 minutes

349
00:13:41,195 --> 00:13:44,198
and one of the things that we'll be doing in mindfulness,

350
00:13:44,198 --> 00:13:45,908
which is gonna be a little bit unusual,

351
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:48,327
and I think weird for some of you, is we're gonna,

352
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:51,497
there are gonna be periods of time that are totally silent.

353
00:13:52,414 --> 00:13:54,375
[Student] So what, are we gonna be meditating?

354
00:13:54,375 --> 00:13:57,253
So let's raise your hand if you wanna have a question.

355
00:13:57,253 --> 00:14:00,005
The biggest misconception is that mindfulness is

356
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,674
spiritual or religious.

357
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,468
Although it can be traced back to

358
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:06,720
very traditional practices,

359
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,015
it can be used in a secular way to address issues

360
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,141
in society today.

361
00:14:11,141 --> 00:14:14,311
What we're gonna try right now is just what I call

362
00:14:14,311 --> 00:14:15,604
mindful posture.

363
00:14:15,604 --> 00:14:18,482
If you're slouching or leaning, just lift off your chair

364
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:19,859
momentarily for a few,

365
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:22,319
we're gonna do this for about two minutes, maybe.

366
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:28,075
And take your hands and decide to put them

367
00:14:28,075 --> 00:14:30,995
either on your desk or in your lap.

368
00:14:30,995 --> 00:14:32,746
[Student] You said put them on your desk?

369
00:14:32,746 --> 00:14:34,373
Or in your lap.

370
00:14:34,832 --> 00:14:38,377
And then notice if anything in your body is moving,

371
00:14:38,377 --> 00:14:41,964
like if your leg is bouncing or your foot's moving,

372
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:43,841
or your fingers are moving.

373
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:47,136
I think of mindfulness as a tool or a skill.

374
00:14:47,136 --> 00:14:48,596
Society and

375
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,056
our culture is training us to

376
00:14:51,056 --> 00:14:54,727
not be focused, so technology is causing us to jump from

377
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:56,896
one thing to the next constantly, all the time.

378
00:14:56,896 --> 00:14:59,523
And when we're asked or required to focus on something,

379
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,901
our brain, actually, is not prepared to do that.

380
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,319
It's not trained to do that.

381
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,195
So I think on a very practical level,

382
00:15:05,195 --> 00:15:07,948
it's just creating more focus in our lives.

383
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:11,493
And try to let everything become still.

384
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:12,328
Ugh.

385
00:15:13,495 --> 00:15:16,123
[Megan] And notice that this is uncomfortable.

386
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,625
[Student] It's not

387
00:15:17,625 --> 00:15:18,375
uncomfortable.

388
00:15:18,417 --> 00:15:20,085
[Megan] And if you feel the need to talk.

389
00:15:20,085 --> 00:15:21,754
It really teaches about

390
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,422
increasing impulse control

391
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,383
so that we get more choice around our actions.

392
00:15:26,383 --> 00:15:28,344
Okay, now relax.

393
00:15:28,344 --> 00:15:30,137
Keep your attention with me.

394
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:32,723
(students laughing)

395
00:15:32,723 --> 00:15:34,558
[Gerardo] I feel horrible.

396
00:15:34,558 --> 00:15:37,561
(students laughing)

397
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:41,357
[Megan] Yeah, tell me why you didn't like it.

398
00:15:41,357 --> 00:15:43,275
It was like, it was alright.

399
00:15:43,275 --> 00:15:45,486
Then later, I couldn't feel my body and

400
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:47,404
it felt kinda weird on my legs, so,

401
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,323
like if I got shot or something, I don't know.

402
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,325
[Megan] Can I have everybody's eyes up here?

403
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:52,242
Thank you.

404
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,202
[Mister Ehnle] Chris?

405
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,328
[Chris] Yes, ma'am?

406
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,162
(students laughing)

407
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:56,664
Before I leave,

408
00:15:57,831 --> 00:16:00,167
before I leave, I wanna tell you guys about

409
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,170
the science behind mindfulness.

410
00:16:03,170 --> 00:16:07,383
Science shows that mindfulness actually affects our brain.

411
00:16:07,383 --> 00:16:09,510
And when we use mindfulness,

412
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:10,886
(girls laughing)

413
00:16:10,886 --> 00:16:11,720
you know what, you guys?

414
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,931
We're gonna have to figure out some way to make this work

415
00:16:13,931 --> 00:16:16,308
since I'm gonna be here 15 times.

416
00:16:17,142 --> 00:16:18,352
[Student] 15 times?

417
00:16:18,352 --> 00:16:20,646
I did find myself having expectations that I

418
00:16:20,646 --> 00:16:23,607
deserved some more time before they would choose to be

419
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:26,652
deliberately disruptive or before you check out,

420
00:16:26,652 --> 00:16:29,196
but I think apathy is part of being a teenager,

421
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:31,365
so I wasn't surprised.

422
00:16:31,365 --> 00:16:34,076
So what I wanna ask is that

423
00:16:34,076 --> 00:16:37,496
there's a certain level of attention in the class

424
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:40,582
that shows that you are at least willing to listen

425
00:16:40,582 --> 00:16:41,750
for awhile.

426
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:42,835
Chris?

427
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:45,087
So, if you want this level of attention,

428
00:16:45,129 --> 00:16:46,880
you gotta make stuff entertaining

429
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,924
'cause kids over here are hyperactive.

430
00:16:48,924 --> 00:16:50,050
Mindfulness

431
00:16:50,050 --> 00:16:51,635
actually is

432
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:54,555
training you to be comfortable

433
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,016
when you're not being entertained.

434
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:00,477
'Cause you will not be entertained 24 hours a day

435
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:01,353
of your whole life.

436
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,688
Hang on.

437
00:17:02,688 --> 00:17:06,442
When Megan came in, I thought, oh man,

438
00:17:06,442 --> 00:17:10,988
we're that bad they gotta bring a t.v. show about us?

439
00:17:11,989 --> 00:17:15,534
I'm not sure how our class was chosen,

440
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,744
but.

441
00:17:16,744 --> 00:17:20,622
[Ling] The kids ask why mindfulness was brought to

442
00:17:20,622 --> 00:17:22,833
their classrooms because it's not being offered in

443
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:25,252
other classrooms, and I think they know the reason why,

444
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:29,256
generally, that the classes are a little bit crazy at times.

445
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:34,887
It's hard to go down that road when they're so used to

446
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:36,638
going down the other road

447
00:17:36,638 --> 00:17:39,808
which is a road of chaos and disorder.

448
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,478
(hip hop music)

449
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,488
If they cooperate,

450
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:56,867
and they, like, pay attention, they would change but

451
00:17:56,867 --> 00:17:59,453
because I know some of the kids won't,

452
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:03,040
I don't know about the class.

453
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:05,417
(girls screaming)

454
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:06,085
[Female Student] Did they get in?

455
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:06,835
Did they get in?

456
00:18:06,877 --> 00:18:07,544
Did they get in?

457
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:08,587
Lesly,

458
00:18:08,629 --> 00:18:10,923
(speaks in foreign language)
she doesn't pay attention in class.

459
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:15,636
She doesn't do homework like she should.

460
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:18,430
It's not my fault.

461
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:21,975
because you didn't tell me where it is!

462
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:24,645
Before, she always paid attention,

463
00:18:24,645 --> 00:18:26,438
turned in her work

464
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:29,817
the teachers never complained.

465
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,072
Not all of my family members

466
00:18:35,072 --> 00:18:38,534
got to finish middle school and high school,

467
00:18:38,534 --> 00:18:42,329
and I want to show them that I can do

468
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,083
what they could have done, and I want to prove to them that

469
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:49,002
I can go to college and show them that

470
00:18:49,002 --> 00:18:52,548
I'm getting a good career and changing my life.

471
00:18:55,175 --> 00:18:57,636
(speaking in foreign language)
We/re going to pray.

472
00:18:59,763 --> 00:19:01,515
We always talk to her.

473
00:19:01,515 --> 00:19:07,396
So, try to limit conversation in class.

474
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:17,865
The class is for studying, paying attention.

475
00:19:17,865 --> 00:19:21,493
friendships are for when you leave school.

476
00:19:23,287 --> 00:19:28,500
I tell you the things you should do, but you don't listen.

477
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:32,880
I go to church and pray for you to open your mind

478
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:36,049
do good in school, do things right

479
00:19:36,049 --> 00:19:37,426
for you not to do bad things.

480
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,553
When I see that she's not doing well

481
00:19:39,553 --> 00:19:41,054
I tell her there's no telephone,

482
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,764
there's no television

483
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:46,435
there's no shopping, going to the stores

484
00:19:46,435 --> 00:19:49,605
or if you want something, I tell her there's nothing

485
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:51,440
because if you don't behave

486
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,275
I'm not going to give you a prize.

487
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,278
If you don't put forth effort

488
00:19:56,278 --> 00:19:59,198
who is going to give you a living so you can live?

489
00:19:59,698 --> 00:20:01,825
Nobody, right?

490
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:06,705
Sometimes I tell her, you've got everything

491
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:09,249
that a person like me doesn't have in their own country.

492
00:20:09,249 --> 00:20:11,251
And you don't know how to take advantage of it.

493
00:20:12,628 --> 00:20:15,714
That makes me sad. For me, as a mother

494
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,592
that's the saddest thing, that so many young

495
00:20:18,592 --> 00:20:21,511
people that are the children of Latino parents

496
00:20:21,511 --> 00:20:23,263
kids who've been born in this country

497
00:20:23,263 --> 00:20:25,098
and they don't finish school.

498
00:20:38,111 --> 00:20:40,489
(bell rings)

499
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:49,456
When the sound of the bell is completely gone for you,

500
00:20:49,456 --> 00:20:50,791
raise your hand.

501
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:56,713
When Megan first came to the class,

502
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,299
we really didn't know what was going on.

503
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:05,264
We're usually loud and we yell across the room and

504
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,224
we just get up from our seats and like,

505
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,809
crack jokes and stuff.

506
00:21:09,935 --> 00:21:13,146
We were just trying not to be our normal selves in class

507
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:16,984
when she came in, but it was kinda hard.

508
00:21:16,984 --> 00:21:18,652
Can you turn this way?

509
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,861
Just go ahead and turn your whole chair

510
00:21:19,861 --> 00:21:21,029
and face that way.

511
00:21:23,865 --> 00:21:25,450
And go ahead and scoot up like,

512
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,576
a foot and a half.

513
00:21:28,996 --> 00:21:30,622
Thanks, but facing that way.

514
00:21:32,124 --> 00:21:33,542
Like, just turn your chair

515
00:21:33,542 --> 00:21:35,544
so you're exactly facing that way.

516
00:21:35,544 --> 00:21:36,044
Thanks.

517
00:21:36,086 --> 00:21:37,087
[Male Student] I am facing that way.

518
00:21:37,129 --> 00:21:39,214
Okay, but do you understand why I'm asking?

519
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,340
Yes.

520
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:41,174
Thank you.

521
00:21:42,759 --> 00:21:45,178
So put your hand on your belly

522
00:21:45,178 --> 00:21:48,682
and everybody take one deep breath

523
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:50,225
that only you can hear.

524
00:21:53,353 --> 00:21:54,730
Let's try it again.

525
00:21:57,065 --> 00:21:57,899
And now,

526
00:21:57,899 --> 00:22:00,235
take five gentle breaths,

527
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:00,861
(students laughing)

528
00:22:00,861 --> 00:22:02,946
noticing if you feel it in your belly.

529
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:07,534
You have your hand on your belly, it gives you another

530
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:10,037
way to feel that you actually are breathing.

531
00:22:10,037 --> 00:22:12,331
Our breathing is responsive to our emotions,

532
00:22:12,331 --> 00:22:15,042
so it's a nice way to stay connected with your experience,

533
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:17,878
is to be watching or noticing your breathing.

534
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:20,630
And then take three breaths, noticing if you feel it

535
00:22:20,630 --> 00:22:22,049
in your chest.

536
00:22:25,635 --> 00:22:26,970
When Megan first came

537
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:28,680
to teach the first mindfulness class,

538
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,349
I was like get outta here.

539
00:22:30,349 --> 00:22:32,684
I don't wanna do this, you know?

540
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,062
I was trying to look like a good kid in the beginning, too,

541
00:22:35,062 --> 00:22:38,106
but then it was fun throwing pencils and stuff, you know?

542
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,025
Not listening to teachers is always fun,

543
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:41,610
but it's not the thing to do.

544
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:43,153
We're gonna do a challenge,

545
00:22:43,153 --> 00:22:47,240
and the challenge is to do mindful breathing for a minute.

546
00:22:47,240 --> 00:22:50,077
So everybody in your mindful posture.

547
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:52,371
(girls laughing)

548
00:22:52,371 --> 00:22:53,205
What?

549
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:53,580
Chair.

550
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,414
No, no, no, no, no, no.

551
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:55,082
It's not no.

552
00:22:55,123 --> 00:22:56,416
No, no, no, no, no.

553
00:22:56,416 --> 00:22:57,250
I don't want to go over there.

554
00:22:57,250 --> 00:22:58,418
I didn't ask if you wanted to.

555
00:22:58,418 --> 00:23:00,170
Yes, you did.

556
00:23:00,170 --> 00:23:02,089
[Megan] So, I know there's some distraction,

557
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:03,715
but we're just gonna continue.

558
00:23:04,466 --> 00:23:07,594
We're gonna do a minute of mindful breathing

559
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:09,346
starting now.

560
00:23:12,474 --> 00:23:13,558
Chris, can you put your hand in?

561
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:14,601
I'm gonna walk by.

562
00:23:15,644 --> 00:23:16,937
Chris?

563
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,271
(speaks in foreign language)

564
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,106
Thank you.

565
00:23:23,110 --> 00:23:25,570
For some of you, there was something about that experience

566
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:27,114
that may have felt pleasant,

567
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:28,156
or positive.

568
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:29,991
Hey, guys?

569
00:23:29,991 --> 00:23:31,284
What's your name again?

570
00:23:31,284 --> 00:23:32,619
Rusty Shackleford.

571
00:23:32,619 --> 00:23:34,746
[Megan] So Matt Rusty Shackleford,

572
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:37,874
(students laughing)

573
00:23:37,874 --> 00:23:40,710
can you help me out by just having your attention up here?

574
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,461
Alright.

575
00:23:41,461 --> 00:23:42,254
[Megan] Okay.

576
00:23:44,131 --> 00:23:46,466
So can I hear from four or five people

577
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:49,594
one word that describes what that was like for you?

578
00:23:49,594 --> 00:23:50,637
Calm.

579
00:23:50,637 --> 00:23:51,471
Calm?

580
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,140
And would you describe that as a pleasant or

581
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:53,974
unpleasant experience?

582
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:54,933
Pleasant.

583
00:23:54,975 --> 00:23:56,101
Thank you for sharing.

584
00:23:56,893 --> 00:23:58,103
Monica, go outside.

585
00:23:58,937 --> 00:24:01,440
You do too much, for real.

586
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,485
I know you don't like expectations.

587
00:24:05,485 --> 00:24:07,154
I do, but I don't like yours.

588
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:09,948
It's not like it's hard to reach them,

589
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,284
it's just like they wanna act like they don't really care

590
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:13,160
about nothing.

591
00:24:13,994 --> 00:24:16,246
But I know that they do care.

592
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:18,081
They're trying to act like they're tough.

593
00:24:18,081 --> 00:24:20,667
They try to act like, oh, I'm better than this, you know?

594
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:23,295
When they're really not better than that.

595
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:25,839
Raise your hand if something about

596
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:27,924
a minute of mindful breathing

597
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:30,010
was unpleasant.

598
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:32,512
I'm not used to breathing so quiet.

599
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,347
I've lived in San Francisco for a long time,

600
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:36,641
so you always hear like cars and stuff.

601
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,186
And it wasn't noisy, so.

602
00:24:39,186 --> 00:24:41,813
Okay, so you're used to the noise in San Francisco.

603
00:24:46,943 --> 00:24:49,154
So we're gonna end right now with the bell.

604
00:24:49,321 --> 00:24:50,739
Ssh.

605
00:24:52,032 --> 00:24:54,409
(bell rings)

606
00:24:59,998 --> 00:25:01,249
We did do mindful breathing,

607
00:25:01,249 --> 00:25:03,418
and so I accomplished what the intention was,

608
00:25:03,418 --> 00:25:06,046
but it didn't feel like the class really got it.

609
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:08,465
And it took 35 minutes.

610
00:25:08,465 --> 00:25:11,468
You just really want to find a way to reach them and

611
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:12,928
you're not, and so I don't know,

612
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:14,930
I don't know where to go next with it.

613
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:21,311
Hey, there's Malik.

614
00:25:21,311 --> 00:25:23,688
They go around the corner.

615
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,735
Steven Hopkins goes to After School with me.

616
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:29,903
That's how we stay out of trouble.

617
00:25:29,903 --> 00:25:32,572
In the beginning, I had like, all As.

618
00:25:32,572 --> 00:25:34,783
And during the middle I just started not wanting to

619
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:35,992
do my work and stuff.

620
00:25:35,992 --> 00:25:38,370
I would just go to school and not even do anything,

621
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:41,039
just not do my work, go have fun.

622
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:41,915
[Dad] What do you want to do?

623
00:25:41,915 --> 00:25:43,124
Yeah, nothing.

624
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,042
[Dad] That's good.

625
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:46,169
Kind of fast though.

626
00:25:46,169 --> 00:25:47,003
Does it?

627
00:25:47,003 --> 00:25:47,546
Yeah.

628
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:49,631
When he comes home, I always ask him are you okay?

629
00:25:49,673 --> 00:25:51,216
How was school, what did you did?

630
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:52,634
Anything change, anything wrong?

631
00:25:52,634 --> 00:25:55,345
So I try to get at least an idea of what happens

632
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:56,680
during the day for him.

633
00:25:58,515 --> 00:26:00,433
If I just put him on the side and never talk to him,

634
00:26:00,433 --> 00:26:01,685
or don't care about what he does,

635
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,852
then that's different.

636
00:26:03,728 --> 00:26:04,563
Yeah.

637
00:26:05,313 --> 00:26:06,439
Gerardo is in trouble now.

638
00:26:06,439 --> 00:26:08,525
For the past maybe, I would say a year, year and a half,

639
00:26:08,525 --> 00:26:10,944
we're having really hard issues with him.

640
00:26:10,944 --> 00:26:11,778
Tardiness.

641
00:26:11,778 --> 00:26:13,238
Attendance.

642
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,656
Behavior.

643
00:26:14,656 --> 00:26:16,908
The friends that he hands with and the things that he does.

644
00:26:16,908 --> 00:26:18,952
It's like if you're doing good, they give you pluses.

645
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,954
If you're fooling around or not in your seat or something,

646
00:26:20,954 --> 00:26:22,205
they give you circles.

647
00:26:22,205 --> 00:26:24,082
How many pluses you got today?

648
00:26:25,709 --> 00:26:27,502
Altogether or in the group.

649
00:26:27,502 --> 00:26:28,336
Eight.

650
00:26:29,671 --> 00:26:31,172
In your group, in table ten?

651
00:26:31,172 --> 00:26:32,132
Eight good?
Yeah.

652
00:26:32,173 --> 00:26:32,841
How many bad?

653
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,842
Seven.

654
00:26:35,176 --> 00:26:36,219
(laughs)

655
00:26:36,261 --> 00:26:37,178
Are we doing equal here?

656
00:26:37,178 --> 00:26:38,471
Are we doing minus or plus?

657
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,598
Come on.

658
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,141
And I was getting referrals sometimes,

659
00:26:41,141 --> 00:26:43,018
five referrals a day, and the thing with him,

660
00:26:43,018 --> 00:26:44,519
he likes to talk back.

661
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:45,854
One time they called me at work and says

662
00:26:45,854 --> 00:26:47,981
you have to come pick up Gerardo right now.

663
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:49,399
We cannot keep him in school no more.

664
00:26:49,399 --> 00:26:51,151
And I'm like, it's 11 in the morning.

665
00:26:51,192 --> 00:26:52,861
He says well, you need to come pick him up.

666
00:26:52,861 --> 00:26:56,197
They just want you to leave the premise and don't come back.

667
00:26:56,197 --> 00:26:57,532
That is pretty bad.

668
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:58,533
But I was doing good, though.

669
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:00,410
I understand, but for how long?

670
00:27:01,453 --> 00:27:03,496
I graduated from Marina Middle School.

671
00:27:03,496 --> 00:27:05,498
I was exactly like Gerardo.

672
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,666
I was very smart.

673
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,669
I was actually the student of the month for

674
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:11,671
six months.

675
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,547
I had

676
00:27:12,547 --> 00:27:15,091
honor roll for about six months.

677
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:17,135
And then everything went down sour, too.

678
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:18,762
I started hanging with the wrong crowd,

679
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:20,805
answering back, not doing homework,

680
00:27:20,805 --> 00:27:23,350
until eventually I got kicked out of school.

681
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:25,101
Sometimes I fool around in class.

682
00:27:25,101 --> 00:27:27,771
Oh, that I know, you don't have to tell me.

683
00:27:27,771 --> 00:27:29,606
Why do you think you sit in the front?

684
00:27:30,357 --> 00:27:31,524
'Cause you're special?

685
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,109
'Cause I love my teacher.

686
00:27:33,109 --> 00:27:34,235
No, you don't.

687
00:27:34,235 --> 00:27:35,278
Alright.

688
00:27:35,278 --> 00:27:36,112
No, it's not alright.

689
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:38,365
Don't just tell me alright just to tell me to be quiet,

690
00:27:38,365 --> 00:27:40,408
I'm trying to make a point here.

691
00:27:40,408 --> 00:27:42,577
It would not be fair for me to go to work on time

692
00:27:42,577 --> 00:27:45,830
and have everybody else be late when I'm on time every time.

693
00:27:45,830 --> 00:27:48,249
I know what my job is, I don't need someone to come tell me

694
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,043
you need to do your job.

695
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:50,418
Yeah.

696
00:27:50,502 --> 00:27:52,545
There's little things out there that I regret I done

697
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:55,090
and I was, believe, I coulda go back, I woulda change it.

698
00:27:55,090 --> 00:27:56,883
That's the thing that I'm trying to teach him,

699
00:27:56,883 --> 00:27:58,760
I says look at my mirror, look where I am.

700
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,011
Look what I gone through.

701
00:28:00,011 --> 00:28:02,847
I been doing dishes, I been doing janitorial work,

702
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:05,225
I been doing all kind of jobs.

703
00:28:05,225 --> 00:28:06,601
I've been selling fruits in the street,

704
00:28:06,601 --> 00:28:08,937
so to me, that's nothing new, but for him,

705
00:28:08,937 --> 00:28:10,605
that he has the chance and the opportunity

706
00:28:10,605 --> 00:28:12,148
to be somebody here,

707
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:14,818
he just doesn't take advantage of it,

708
00:28:14,818 --> 00:28:16,861
I think it's a waste of time.

709
00:28:16,861 --> 00:28:17,737
I don't think the school,

710
00:28:17,737 --> 00:28:20,323
but he needs to come up with better choices, though.

711
00:28:20,323 --> 00:28:21,241
Right?

712
00:28:21,241 --> 00:28:22,075
Yeah.

713
00:28:23,576 --> 00:28:26,246
(bell rings)

714
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,665
[Student] Sound like we're in Hong Kong.

715
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,125
Can I have your attention?

716
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,670
So the way things went on Monday,

717
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:36,798
it's not gonna work for mindfulness, so I need to find out

718
00:28:36,798 --> 00:28:39,634
who really does not want to be here for mindfulness.

719
00:28:39,634 --> 00:28:42,220
I'm gonna need each of you that are raising your hand

720
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:44,764
that you don't want to be here, to tell me why.

721
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:47,225
So you don't want to be here because?

722
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,309
It's boring?

723
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,061
It's boring and it's stupid.

724
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:51,646
[Megan] Do you ever find other things in your life

725
00:28:51,646 --> 00:28:52,605
boring or stupid?

726
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:53,481
No.

727
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:54,441
[Megan] No, never?

728
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:55,316
So this is the only thing?

729
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,609
So you definitely wanna go?

730
00:28:56,609 --> 00:28:57,444
Yeah.

731
00:28:57,444 --> 00:28:58,361
[Megan] Okay.

732
00:28:58,361 --> 00:29:00,613
There are a few kids

733
00:29:00,613 --> 00:29:03,700
who make the rest of the class particularly challenging.

734
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:06,453
If there were five of them that weren't in there,

735
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,038
then the majority of them actually would be trying

736
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:10,790
and would be participating.

737
00:29:10,790 --> 00:29:12,459
Diego, come here.

738
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,293
And stand up.

739
00:29:16,129 --> 00:29:17,756
Just come all the way over here.

740
00:29:21,468 --> 00:29:24,095
Okay, they're just gonna head outside with you guys.

741
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:25,263
And we're gonna have the class without you.

742
00:29:25,263 --> 00:29:26,347
Thank you.

743
00:29:26,347 --> 00:29:28,975
It's our philosophy as a program that all students

744
00:29:28,975 --> 00:29:30,685
are present in the class, even if they are the

745
00:29:30,685 --> 00:29:32,979
disruptive ones, because we believe that they are the ones

746
00:29:32,979 --> 00:29:35,315
that might even gain the most benefit.

747
00:29:35,315 --> 00:29:37,901
But, right now what I'm seeing is

748
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,861
there's a handful of kids that are causing

749
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:43,239
so much disruption, that it's at the expense of the other

750
00:29:43,239 --> 00:29:44,574
30 kids in the class.

751
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:48,745
30 kids are waiting for the class to settle down.

752
00:29:48,745 --> 00:29:50,079
If you're participating in the class,

753
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:52,123
please turn your chairs this way.

754
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:53,541
Everybody's eyes up here.

755
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,002
Chris?

756
00:29:59,672 --> 00:30:02,008
It really did strike me when I looked around at the end

757
00:30:02,008 --> 00:30:03,676
and there was one boy

758
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:06,721
just looking at me so intently, and then I looked around

759
00:30:06,721 --> 00:30:08,765
and I realized, well, a good half of the class

760
00:30:08,765 --> 00:30:10,600
is just waiting for the rest of the class to

761
00:30:10,600 --> 00:30:11,768
get it together.

762
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:16,189
Some of the people that are ready and willing to do it

763
00:30:16,981 --> 00:30:19,234
are not gonna feel comfortable unless the rest of the class

764
00:30:19,234 --> 00:30:20,235
is settled in.

765
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,197
[Student] So why don't you ask all the kids in here

766
00:30:24,197 --> 00:30:26,908
if they're feeling comfortable right now?

767
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:29,786
That's a conversation that I've been trying to have.

768
00:30:32,705 --> 00:30:35,583
So raise your hand when the sound of the bell is gone.

769
00:30:37,502 --> 00:30:39,879
(bell rings)

770
00:30:42,549 --> 00:30:44,801
(alarm rings)

771
00:30:44,801 --> 00:30:47,303
Oh, we're supposed to be going to lunch.

772
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:52,016
It's like hitting a brick wall.

773
00:30:52,016 --> 00:30:56,396
I just am frustrated and kind of hopeless.

774
00:30:56,396 --> 00:30:59,065
The defiance is so deliberate and

775
00:30:59,065 --> 00:31:01,150
I don't know if I can work with that

776
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:03,611
in this large of a group.

777
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:16,583
So, I sat down with Mister Braxton and Miss Busche to ask

778
00:31:16,583 --> 00:31:19,419
how I should respond to this class.

779
00:31:19,419 --> 00:31:20,420
The problem that I'm

780
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:23,089
meeting with these kids in particular is that

781
00:31:23,089 --> 00:31:25,925
four kids are being deliberately disruptive

782
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,469
at the expense of 30 other students.

783
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:29,762
We're a public school.

784
00:31:29,762 --> 00:31:32,682
We take everybody where they're at and we do

785
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:35,768
the best job we can with them and the idea that

786
00:31:36,102 --> 00:31:37,896
30 kids are waiting for five kids.

787
00:31:37,896 --> 00:31:38,396
[Megan] Yeah.

788
00:31:38,396 --> 00:31:40,857
Or that somehow these kids are the victims

789
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:44,485
or they're not getting something at the expense of others,

790
00:31:44,485 --> 00:31:46,446
that's a paradigm I prefer not to set up,

791
00:31:46,446 --> 00:31:48,031
that some get and some don't

792
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,617
and that we sacrifice five so that others do.

793
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,618
We should give

794
00:31:51,618 --> 00:31:53,286
the same thing to everybody.

795
00:31:53,286 --> 00:31:54,829
It may not come in the same way, though.

796
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:55,830
And I'm okay with that.

797
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:57,916
Let's take this one day at a time.

798
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,877
And today we'll take those four out for the class.

799
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,962
You'll have some time with them and then maybe

800
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:05,131
you and I can touch base before I leave today

801
00:32:05,131 --> 00:32:07,425
just to hear how that conversation went.

802
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,134
And then

803
00:32:08,134 --> 00:32:11,220
reintegrating them when that class comes back together

804
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,182
as a whole, it's not foreign to four kids in the class.

805
00:32:14,182 --> 00:32:14,807
[Megan] Right.

806
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,977
(somber music)

807
00:32:34,243 --> 00:32:37,163
I had a parent teacher conference and it was bad,

808
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:40,541
'cause the teachers were talking bad about me.

809
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,043
Not a lick of work.

810
00:32:42,043 --> 00:32:43,544
Nothing turned in,

811
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,213
math or science.

812
00:32:45,213 --> 00:32:48,007
I always do this on the overhead projector.

813
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,509
By not doing homework,

814
00:32:49,509 --> 00:32:53,012
she thinks that's the way she can get back at the teacher.

815
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:56,349
Everyday, she should be able to bring a paper home

816
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:57,558
that looks like this.

817
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,477
This is what we did in math class today.

818
00:32:59,477 --> 00:33:02,271
She got behind in math and

819
00:33:02,271 --> 00:33:03,940
reading and writing, also,

820
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,150
because the teacher sent her to the

821
00:33:06,150 --> 00:33:06,985
office.

822
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:09,112
[Mister Ehnle] We talked about it for three days in a row.

823
00:33:09,112 --> 00:33:10,321
When I went to school,

824
00:33:10,321 --> 00:33:12,657
homework means like two, three hours and then

825
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,200
I have my free time.

826
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:19,205
Me, Lyn and Lesly Martinez worked on it.

827
00:33:19,205 --> 00:33:22,041
In America, it's like, boring for them.

828
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:25,378
Getting a diploma is like, whatever.

829
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,046
What is that going to get?

830
00:33:27,046 --> 00:33:29,090
You really shouldn't even think that's bad.

831
00:33:29,132 --> 00:33:30,383
You're gonna be so proud of yourself.

832
00:33:30,383 --> 00:33:33,886
The Principal said that if she gets one more thing,

833
00:33:33,886 --> 00:33:35,888
she'll have to change the school.

834
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:40,143
But I don't want her to get out of Marina.

835
00:33:40,143 --> 00:33:41,227
I like the school.

836
00:33:41,227 --> 00:33:43,187
She could do very well

837
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:46,190
if she focused and really decided

838
00:33:46,190 --> 00:33:47,734
I'm gonna be a great student.

839
00:33:48,776 --> 00:33:51,863
I think I would have to change my whole attitude

840
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,698
and start doing my work

841
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:54,907
and my homework.

842
00:33:55,783 --> 00:33:57,452
All of my homework.

843
00:33:57,452 --> 00:33:59,245
[Mister Ehnle] I think it's really up to you.

844
00:33:59,245 --> 00:34:01,664
I think you have the resources and it just takes

845
00:34:01,664 --> 00:34:04,292
a decision on your part to do your part.

846
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,586
I hope to pass.

847
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,504
I would feel kind of sad.

848
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:12,300
If I don't pass, then I don't get to go on with my friends

849
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:13,426
and move on.

850
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:15,595
Doesn't make any sense, to come to school

851
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,888
for the full year

852
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,265
if at the end, you don't graduate.

853
00:34:19,265 --> 00:34:20,099
I waste my time.

854
00:34:20,099 --> 00:34:21,434
[Jacqueline] I did think that was a wake up call.

855
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:24,187
I walked out thinking start doing good,

856
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:26,898
stop getting referrals and start doing my homework

857
00:34:26,898 --> 00:34:28,191
and classwork.

858
00:34:34,655 --> 00:34:35,907
When I wake up in the morning,

859
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,825
and it's the day that we're teaching at this school,

860
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,453
I have a mixture of mild dread

861
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:45,083
and also some determination of what can I do today?

862
00:34:47,627 --> 00:34:48,878
These classes are

863
00:34:48,878 --> 00:34:50,713
on my mind all the time.

864
00:34:50,713 --> 00:34:52,507
When I feel like I'm not reaching them,

865
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:55,009
that's not acceptable so I wanna get creative

866
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:57,095
and figure out how to reach 'em.

867
00:34:57,095 --> 00:35:00,264
(contemplative music)

868
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,653
(bell rings)

869
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:16,906
Okay.

870
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:18,908
I'm gonna have you guys start

871
00:35:18,908 --> 00:35:20,993
leading mindfulness.

872
00:35:20,993 --> 00:35:23,037
[Gerardo] Please let your eyes close.

873
00:35:24,664 --> 00:35:27,166
(bell rings)

874
00:35:43,182 --> 00:35:46,686
I wasn't planning to give it a try today in class but,

875
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,604
I kinda did.

876
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:54,777
Okay, thank you.

877
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:55,444
Alright, you guys.

878
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:59,448
What do you think is your biggest influence in your life?

879
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,868
Everybody started paying attention

880
00:36:01,868 --> 00:36:04,579
and it was different from the other classes.

881
00:36:04,620 --> 00:36:05,538
[Megan] Lesly?

882
00:36:05,538 --> 00:36:06,289
Dad.

883
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,373
[Megan] Dad.

884
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:08,833
Jacqueline?

885
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:09,709
My sister.

886
00:36:09,709 --> 00:36:12,962
[Megan] Okay, so we've got dad, sister.

887
00:36:12,962 --> 00:36:13,546
Gerardo?

888
00:36:13,546 --> 00:36:14,380
[Gerardo] Art.

889
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,214
Art.

890
00:36:15,256 --> 00:36:17,300
Would you be surprised if I told you

891
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:20,553
the biggest influence in your life is your mind?

892
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:23,222
And when we practice mindfulness, you're strengthening

893
00:36:23,222 --> 00:36:26,100
your mind to have the influence on your life

894
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,727
that you want it to have.

895
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,855
And when we practice mindful breathing,

896
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,608
we're developing the strength of our mind

897
00:36:33,608 --> 00:36:35,526
to have influence on us.

898
00:36:36,569 --> 00:36:37,904
It was hard to sit still

899
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:40,656
and to not move my hands or anything.

900
00:36:41,866 --> 00:36:45,411
It was just like, okay, I just need to calm down and

901
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:49,123
tell myself to stop moving to see if this works or not.

902
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:52,335
One way that we can create influence in our life

903
00:36:52,335 --> 00:36:56,589
with our mind is by having thoughts on purpose,

904
00:36:56,589 --> 00:36:58,633
rather than thoughts on accident.

905
00:36:59,592 --> 00:37:02,261
So go ahead and get back into a mindful position.

906
00:37:03,429 --> 00:37:06,098
I'm gonna say a phrase.

907
00:37:06,098 --> 00:37:07,558
So the first thing I want you to repeat,

908
00:37:07,558 --> 00:37:10,436
silently in your mind, is

909
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,230
I wish

910
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:14,148
for myself to be happy.

911
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:17,526
And then try the wish, I wish for myself to be healthy.

912
00:37:21,030 --> 00:37:24,242
And now create a wish in your mind that is

913
00:37:24,283 --> 00:37:25,534
specific to yourself,

914
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:27,703
whether it's something you want to accomplish,

915
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:29,622
a quality that you want to have,

916
00:37:29,622 --> 00:37:31,249
something you want to do.

917
00:37:31,249 --> 00:37:33,292
I wish for myself,

918
00:37:33,292 --> 00:37:34,710
you fill in the blank.

919
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:50,142
It just helps you relax and forget about everything else.

920
00:37:50,142 --> 00:37:52,061
Is anyone willing to say

921
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,355
what they wished for themselves?

922
00:37:54,355 --> 00:37:56,440
Yes, what was your wish for yourself?

923
00:37:56,440 --> 00:37:57,608
An easier life.

924
00:37:58,901 --> 00:37:59,652
[Megan] Thank you.

925
00:37:59,652 --> 00:38:00,486
Gerardo?

926
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:02,780
To do better in school.

927
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:03,656
[Megan] Great.

928
00:38:03,656 --> 00:38:05,157
In his class.

929
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,784
[Megan] Thank you.

930
00:38:06,784 --> 00:38:08,703
You wish to do better in school,

931
00:38:08,703 --> 00:38:10,413
particularly Mister Ehnle's class.

932
00:38:10,413 --> 00:38:10,955
Yeah.

933
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,332
I want to move to Alaska.

934
00:38:13,332 --> 00:38:14,667
[Megan] You wish to move to Alaska?

935
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:15,209
Yeah.

936
00:38:15,251 --> 00:38:17,169
Okay, great, thank you.

937
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,965
Raise your hand if this was the first time that you

938
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,759
had thoughts on purpose about your happiness.

939
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:26,095
Okay.

940
00:38:26,095 --> 00:38:30,224
I want you, three times today, wish yourself happiness.

941
00:38:30,224 --> 00:38:30,641
Okay?

942
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,893
But your challenge is to remember to do it.

943
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:35,479
And I want to express my deep appreciation

944
00:38:35,479 --> 00:38:37,440
for your participation today.

945
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:40,192
Today's class definitely does make me feel more hopeful

946
00:38:40,192 --> 00:38:42,361
that we're gonna get somewhere in this class.

947
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:44,739
That room really shifted today and I felt like

948
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:47,199
the students really participated in a way that

949
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:49,285
was helpful to them, as in each individual,

950
00:38:49,285 --> 00:38:51,203
but also as a classroom.

951
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:52,830
Okay, thanks.

952
00:38:52,830 --> 00:38:54,081
Thank you, Mister Ehnle.

953
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,044
I have thoughts about the mindfulness program.

954
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,213
I'm perfectly willing to participate and

955
00:39:01,213 --> 00:39:02,965
I hope it helps students

956
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:07,053
in learning and effectively using the opportunity

957
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:10,222
that is their middle school experience.

958
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,641
(soft music)

959
00:39:26,739 --> 00:39:28,908
[Students] Six, seven, eight.

960
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:32,536
Good morning, again.

961
00:39:32,536 --> 00:39:33,162
[Student] Hi.

962
00:39:33,162 --> 00:39:34,080
Hi.

963
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:35,247
Good morning.

964
00:39:35,289 --> 00:39:36,374
How are you?

965
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,416
[Student] Good.

966
00:39:37,708 --> 00:39:40,711
We're gonna go into mindful listening.

967
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,089
I encourage you to have an open mind this morning,

968
00:39:43,089 --> 00:39:44,173
while we try something that you

969
00:39:44,173 --> 00:39:46,133
probably haven't done before.

970
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:48,594
(bell rings)

971
00:39:52,681 --> 00:39:56,727
Keeping your attention on sound, listen to the sounds

972
00:39:56,727 --> 00:39:58,437
outside the room.

973
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:03,401
(children chatting)

974
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,656
And then focus on the sounds inside of you.

975
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:21,293
At first, well, I thought she was like a voodoo person,

976
00:40:21,293 --> 00:40:23,796
'cause of what she was wearing.

977
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:27,383
You guys got really mindful.

978
00:40:27,383 --> 00:40:28,968
Can you identify how you felt

979
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:30,886
listening to the sounds outside?

980
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:32,263
I was a little impatient.

981
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:33,222
[Megan] A little impatient?

982
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,056
Yeah.

983
00:40:34,056 --> 00:40:35,057
[Megan] Yeah, why?

984
00:40:35,057 --> 00:40:37,935
'Cause I'm used to moving and chatting a lot.

985
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:39,728
[Megan] You're used to moving and chatting,

986
00:40:39,728 --> 00:40:40,813
exactly.

987
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,982
So try to be mindful of sounds,

988
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:45,901
outside, inside, inside yourself.

989
00:40:45,901 --> 00:40:47,653
And I will see you on Monday.

990
00:40:47,653 --> 00:40:49,989
Thank you again, you guys, that was great.

991
00:40:49,989 --> 00:40:52,867
(students applauding)

992
00:40:53,993 --> 00:40:55,536
Mindfulness program is,

993
00:40:55,536 --> 00:40:56,579
it's alright.

994
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,663
It's okay.

995
00:40:57,663 --> 00:41:00,624
I think it'll only help certain kids

996
00:41:00,624 --> 00:41:02,585
that really is interested in it.

997
00:41:02,585 --> 00:41:05,171
Some kids just come to school because

998
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,922
they just feel like socializing.

999
00:41:07,756 --> 00:41:09,341
And some of the other kids,

1000
00:41:09,341 --> 00:41:13,137
they're more interested in school and the programs

1001
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:15,222
that happen at the school.

1002
00:41:15,222 --> 00:41:17,641
(jazz music)

1003
00:41:24,857 --> 00:41:28,694
Omar, he was really getting a lot of trouble in school.

1004
00:41:28,694 --> 00:41:30,696
He had straight Fs.

1005
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:34,241
Oh, he'll say one D, but to me, that's still straight Fs.

1006
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:37,036
Had very bad discipline problems,

1007
00:41:37,036 --> 00:41:40,539
a discipline problem with not doing what the teacher says.

1008
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,791
And just a problem kid.

1009
00:41:46,045 --> 00:41:47,713
How you doing?

1010
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,173
How was your day?

1011
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:50,049
[Omar] Good.

1012
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,885
(jazz music)

1013
00:41:55,471 --> 00:41:56,889
How's your asthma?

1014
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:57,723
[Omar] Alright.

1015
00:41:58,599 --> 00:42:00,726
Me and my husband, we thought it would be best

1016
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,562
for him to stay with us, as I had just retired.

1017
00:42:03,562 --> 00:42:04,855
There's some cookies.

1018
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,442
What you got, progress report?

1019
00:42:08,442 --> 00:42:09,693
Yeah.

1020
00:42:09,693 --> 00:42:11,070
He brings home a progress report,

1021
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:12,905
that's one of the things that he's required to bring home,

1022
00:42:12,905 --> 00:42:14,573
to me, everyday,

1023
00:42:14,573 --> 00:42:18,244
and that's been every day since he's been going to Marina.

1024
00:42:18,244 --> 00:42:19,703
But, what about Miss Illes?

1025
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:21,455
There's nothing for Miss Illes.

1026
00:42:21,455 --> 00:42:23,415
Everyday I've been asking you for.

1027
00:42:23,415 --> 00:42:26,168
Omar can be quite challenging when he's defiant.

1028
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:27,920
Quite challenging.

1029
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,588
I forget.

1030
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:31,215
But that's not acceptable, right?

1031
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,091
Alright.

1032
00:42:32,883 --> 00:42:34,927
So when are you gonna start remembering?

1033
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:39,265
I need to know what she says, I know what you tell me.

1034
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:42,268
[Omar Voiceover] She has expectations from me.

1035
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,353
She just wants me to do good in school.

1036
00:42:44,353 --> 00:42:46,772
I need you to put down what she says about you.

1037
00:42:46,772 --> 00:42:49,525
[Omar Voiceover] She's pushing me to do well.

1038
00:42:49,525 --> 00:42:51,819
Sometimes I don't really listen to her.

1039
00:42:51,819 --> 00:42:53,237
I just didn't do it this morning.

1040
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,613
I think you need to start doing more.

1041
00:42:54,613 --> 00:42:56,407
I don't really care,

1042
00:42:56,824 --> 00:42:58,742
I don't have nothing to say to her.

1043
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:02,705
I just want to see some improvement from you, you know?

1044
00:43:09,295 --> 00:43:12,298
The best thing about raising Omar is

1045
00:43:12,298 --> 00:43:13,591
since I'm retired now,

1046
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:16,135
I get to spend a lot of time with him,

1047
00:43:16,135 --> 00:43:18,971
whereas before, I was working, trying to make ends meet,

1048
00:43:18,971 --> 00:43:20,139
rushing with dinner.

1049
00:43:20,139 --> 00:43:22,266
Just didn't have that time to sit

1050
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,810
and really appreciate him being there.

1051
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:29,315
But now, I love it.

1052
00:43:29,315 --> 00:43:31,150
Just being there for him.

1053
00:43:35,321 --> 00:43:38,657
He's a great person, he has a big heart.

1054
00:43:38,657 --> 00:43:42,286
But, he has a lot of disappointment that keeps surfacing.

1055
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:43,370
[Omar] Why?

1056
00:43:43,370 --> 00:43:45,289
'Cause I'm gonna win.

1057
00:43:45,331 --> 00:43:46,582
Alright, let's play Horse, though.

1058
00:43:46,582 --> 00:43:48,250
He needs to learn how to

1059
00:43:48,250 --> 00:43:51,211
handle those disappointments or negativity,

1060
00:43:51,211 --> 00:43:53,964
so he doesn't feel like he's lost the battle.

1061
00:43:57,217 --> 00:43:58,761
Must be butter on the ball.

1062
00:43:58,761 --> 00:43:59,511
It's no butter,

1063
00:43:59,511 --> 00:44:00,679
there's probably butter on your fingers.

1064
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:01,930
With practice,

1065
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:04,516
mindfulness would work for him

1066
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:07,519
but it would really be hard to get through that curtain

1067
00:44:07,519 --> 00:44:09,396
of anger,

1068
00:44:09,396 --> 00:44:10,939
getting hold of it

1069
00:44:10,939 --> 00:44:12,775
for him to grasp it.

1070
00:44:16,028 --> 00:44:17,279
We're gonna get through that,

1071
00:44:17,279 --> 00:44:19,239
and mindfulness is going to help.

1072
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:26,413
(bell rings)

1073
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,003
Today I brought you something.

1074
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:35,923
What I brought is something that we can eat.

1075
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:40,052
What I brought that we can eat is raisins.

1076
00:44:40,052 --> 00:44:42,054
(students laughing)

1077
00:44:43,222 --> 00:44:46,392
Okay, so somebody tell me your three reactions.

1078
00:44:46,392 --> 00:44:46,892
Yeah?

1079
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:49,353
My first reaction, I was excited.

1080
00:44:50,229 --> 00:44:51,814
Second one,

1081
00:44:51,814 --> 00:44:52,648
I was like,

1082
00:44:53,565 --> 00:44:54,900
okay.

1083
00:44:54,900 --> 00:44:57,069
The excitement kinda went away.

1084
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,737
Then you said raisins.

1085
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:00,114
I don't eat raisins.

1086
00:45:00,114 --> 00:45:01,907
(group laughing)

1087
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:03,242
I'm gonna hand them out.

1088
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,744
So just hold it right now, don't eat 'em yet.

1089
00:45:06,745 --> 00:45:08,747
So what I'd like you to do is

1090
00:45:08,747 --> 00:45:09,790
open your mouth.

1091
00:45:10,207 --> 00:45:12,084
Ssh, we're gonna do this quietly.

1092
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:14,044
And take a whole minute to chew it.

1093
00:45:14,086 --> 00:45:15,129
[Student] A whole minute?

1094
00:45:16,088 --> 00:45:18,465
[Megan] And what I want you to pay attention to

1095
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:22,594
is how your raisin changes.

1096
00:45:24,263 --> 00:45:25,597
[Student] It's so sour.

1097
00:45:25,597 --> 00:45:27,182
We want to bring mindfulness

1098
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:30,185
into our entire experience, not just

1099
00:45:30,185 --> 00:45:32,104
sitting still with our eyes closed.

1100
00:45:32,104 --> 00:45:37,109
Mindful eating gives us a chance to experiment with

1101
00:45:37,276 --> 00:45:40,612
being extra present in something that we do everyday.

1102
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:42,948
I want you to notice the flavor, how it changes.

1103
00:45:42,948 --> 00:45:45,033
The texture, how it changes.

1104
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:46,952
Every moment of our day includes our senses

1105
00:45:46,952 --> 00:45:48,912
to some extent, so it's a great way to bring them

1106
00:45:48,912 --> 00:45:50,831
all together in that one moment.

1107
00:45:50,831 --> 00:45:53,125
But your challenge is, the next time that you are

1108
00:45:53,125 --> 00:45:56,462
eating something that you like, I want you to be mindful

1109
00:45:56,462 --> 00:45:58,756
of it so that you can experience it

1110
00:45:58,756 --> 00:46:00,966
differently than you have in the past.

1111
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:03,343
Okay?

1112
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,303
Thank you, you guys.

1113
00:46:04,303 --> 00:46:05,554
Have a great rest of your week.

1114
00:46:05,554 --> 00:46:06,930
I'll see you next week.

1115
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:12,978
[Lunchlady] It's $5.50.

1116
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:24,823
You guys ready?

1117
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,829
Come on.

1118
00:46:32,539 --> 00:46:33,373
Come here.

1119
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:37,836
(Spanish music)

1120
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,177
I love my friends.

1121
00:46:45,219 --> 00:46:46,804
I can tell them anything.

1122
00:46:50,766 --> 00:46:52,518
That's the only reason why I come to school,

1123
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:54,394
to come see my friends.

1124
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:58,315
I don't like being in class

1125
00:46:58,315 --> 00:46:59,525
'cause it's boring.

1126
00:47:00,901 --> 00:47:04,112
I think mindfulness is more boring than class.

1127
00:47:04,112 --> 00:47:05,531
Okay, wait, wait, stop.

1128
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:06,949
Okay, go.

1129
00:47:06,949 --> 00:47:10,369
One, one, two, three, one, two, three.

1130
00:47:10,369 --> 00:47:12,913
At school, everybody trying to see

1131
00:47:12,913 --> 00:47:15,040
how far they can go,

1132
00:47:15,040 --> 00:47:16,416
that including Jacqueline.

1133
00:47:18,043 --> 00:47:20,128
Move the damn chairs, you two.

1134
00:47:20,212 --> 00:47:22,422
(girls laughing)

1135
00:47:22,422 --> 00:47:23,674
stand right there.

1136
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:25,425
[Jacqueline] I don't tell my parents everything.

1137
00:47:25,467 --> 00:47:27,886
Parents take everything too seriously.

1138
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:32,224
She have to be a better person if she don't want to

1139
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:35,394
struggle when she gets 20, 22.

1140
00:47:35,394 --> 00:47:38,689
I think it's going to get into her

1141
00:47:39,648 --> 00:47:41,149
at some point.

1142
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:44,236
[Megan] Raise your hand if you have somebody in your life

1143
00:47:44,236 --> 00:47:46,405
who you have difficulty with but it's somebody

1144
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:48,282
that you care about a lot

1145
00:47:48,323 --> 00:47:49,700
or you love.

1146
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,578
And bring to mind this person who you care about,

1147
00:47:52,578 --> 00:47:54,746
but maybe there's some challenge with.

1148
00:47:54,746 --> 00:47:56,373
Repeat silently,

1149
00:47:57,082 --> 00:47:59,626
I wish for you to be happy.

1150
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,297
I wish for you to be happy.

1151
00:48:03,338 --> 00:48:06,550
Ever since my parents broke up, I really

1152
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:09,011
didn't care if I was angry or not.

1153
00:48:09,011 --> 00:48:12,764
My teachers and everything, like I really didn't care

1154
00:48:12,764 --> 00:48:15,934
if they were frustrated with me or anything.

1155
00:48:15,934 --> 00:48:17,978
[Megan] I wish for you to be safe.

1156
00:48:21,023 --> 00:48:23,233
I wish for you to be safe.

1157
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:25,569
Gerardo has a lot of anger towards me.

1158
00:48:25,569 --> 00:48:28,614
I think we have up and downs like everybody.

1159
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:32,618
Sometimes we get along good, we have fun together,

1160
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:34,453
we spend time together.

1161
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,705
And sometimes we just don't get along.

1162
00:48:37,581 --> 00:48:41,084
Sometimes I think it's because I'm not living with his dad

1163
00:48:41,084 --> 00:48:43,587
and it's hard for him to understand that we're

1164
00:48:43,587 --> 00:48:45,213
not together anymore.

1165
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:50,302
Find a wish on your own that's meaningful

1166
00:48:50,302 --> 00:48:52,971
regarding this person, and you make the wish.

1167
00:48:52,971 --> 00:48:54,306
You choose the wish.

1168
00:48:57,142 --> 00:48:59,770
Sometimes mom, she yells at me.

1169
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,647
The whole place just feels all

1170
00:49:02,147 --> 00:49:04,066
like a pot of water that's cooking, you know?

1171
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:05,150
It's all heated.

1172
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:06,693
Sometimes you can run away form it,

1173
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:08,111
sometimes you really can't.

1174
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,197
Sometimes you just gotta like, be there,

1175
00:49:10,197 --> 00:49:13,200
and you gotta burn, the little pot thing.

1176
00:49:13,492 --> 00:49:15,202
[Megan] Let your attention rest in your body,

1177
00:49:15,202 --> 00:49:18,747
just noticing how your body feels and how your mind feels.

1178
00:49:24,503 --> 00:49:28,382
I want Gerardo to graduate, have a degree.

1179
00:49:28,382 --> 00:49:30,175
I know that he can do it,

1180
00:49:30,175 --> 00:49:34,012
but right now it's tough timing, it's really hard for him

1181
00:49:34,012 --> 00:49:35,347
to focus in school.

1182
00:49:35,347 --> 00:49:38,308
But I want him to be somebody in life.

1183
00:49:38,308 --> 00:49:39,309
[Megan] That was great,

1184
00:49:39,351 --> 00:49:42,020
but I'm really curious if anyone is willing to share

1185
00:49:42,020 --> 00:49:43,271
what that was like.

1186
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:49,861
The room felt still, but when I looked at each

1187
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:52,447
individual student, I didn't know what was going on

1188
00:49:52,447 --> 00:49:55,242
for them and they're not being really forthcoming

1189
00:49:55,242 --> 00:49:56,326
and sharing.

1190
00:49:59,413 --> 00:50:00,580
Can I have a show of hands

1191
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:03,041
if anybody thought that it was helpful

1192
00:50:03,041 --> 00:50:04,543
or that you learned something?

1193
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,461
Or you realized something?

1194
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:09,047
By the end, hopefully they do have a tool that they can

1195
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,716
depend on or

1196
00:50:10,716 --> 00:50:12,217
draw upon in

1197
00:50:12,217 --> 00:50:14,261
moments of need.

1198
00:50:14,636 --> 00:50:18,724
("Ready or Not" by The Fugees)

1199
00:50:31,361 --> 00:50:33,321
This morning I used mindfulness 'cause mom,

1200
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:36,616
she was yelling at me 'cause I didn't get up in the morning.

1201
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:37,909
And I was just mad.

1202
00:50:40,620 --> 00:50:42,497
I was just gonna lock the door and like,

1203
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:44,416
go back to sleep and not go to school today

1204
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,876
but then I,

1205
00:50:46,376 --> 00:50:48,086
I just chilled for a little bit, I used mindfulness

1206
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:50,922
real quick and it made me feel more calm.

1207
00:50:51,590 --> 00:50:53,216
It kind of woke me up, too.

1208
00:50:55,510 --> 00:50:57,554
And I came to school.

1209
00:50:57,554 --> 00:50:59,973
♪ Gonna find you ♪

1210
00:50:59,973 --> 00:51:02,976
♪ And take it slowly ♪

1211
00:51:02,976 --> 00:51:05,771
♪ Ready or not, here I come ♪

1212
00:51:05,771 --> 00:51:08,023
♪ You can't hide ♪

1213
00:51:08,356 --> 00:51:09,608
Good morning.

1214
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:15,280
So, what I want to try this time,

1215
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:17,199
is while you're doing mindful breathing,

1216
00:51:17,199 --> 00:51:20,118
I'm gonna deliberately gonna make a little bit of noise.

1217
00:51:20,118 --> 00:51:21,787
And using the anchor words

1218
00:51:21,787 --> 00:51:23,080
breathing in

1219
00:51:23,080 --> 00:51:24,706
and breathing out will help you stay

1220
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,792
focused on your breathing even when there's some

1221
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,044
distraction or chaos.

1222
00:51:29,044 --> 00:51:31,463
(bell rings)

1223
00:51:33,048 --> 00:51:35,926
Breathing in, breathing out.

1224
00:51:38,345 --> 00:51:39,513
(door slams)

1225
00:51:45,060 --> 00:51:48,105
I wasn't surprised in the beginning when things got quiet

1226
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:50,982
people would like, make fart noises and stuff.

1227
00:51:52,484 --> 00:51:54,820
But later on,

1228
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:57,155
like maybe like a month later,

1229
00:51:57,155 --> 00:51:58,865
things got better.

1230
00:51:58,865 --> 00:52:01,743
Things were actually silent when she rang the bell.

1231
00:52:02,494 --> 00:52:04,955
And now when she rings the bell, we could be like,

1232
00:52:04,955 --> 00:52:07,457
yelling and stuff, and fighting, but we still know

1233
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,459
when that bell rings,

1234
00:52:09,459 --> 00:52:10,585
that we stop.

1235
00:52:12,254 --> 00:52:14,673
(soft music)

1236
00:52:22,806 --> 00:52:24,224
Go by the court, Alex.

1237
00:52:25,016 --> 00:52:26,852
I haven't talked about mindfulness with my friends.

1238
00:52:26,852 --> 00:52:28,687
I talked about it with my family.

1239
00:52:30,355 --> 00:52:31,857
I have one brother.

1240
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,696
I woulda had another brother, but he died.

1241
00:52:40,699 --> 00:52:44,035
I learned how to play basketball from him.

1242
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:48,540
My brother was twenty

1243
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:50,375
two.

1244
00:52:51,751 --> 00:52:53,420
So dude, he said he gonna come?

1245
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,255
[Mother] No, he want us to come and get him.

1246
00:52:55,255 --> 00:52:56,173
Is he gonna come to concert with us?

1247
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:58,592
After his brother died, he changed in school,

1248
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,385
his grades went down.

1249
00:53:00,385 --> 00:53:04,222
His behavior was kind of nonchalant,

1250
00:53:04,264 --> 00:53:07,225
like he didn't really care about too much anything.

1251
00:53:08,393 --> 00:53:10,103
And when he got a little older,

1252
00:53:10,103 --> 00:53:12,731
that's when you start trying to get in trouble and stuff,

1253
00:53:12,731 --> 00:53:13,773
huh?

1254
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:14,566
Yeah.

1255
00:53:14,566 --> 00:53:15,400
Yeah.

1256
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:18,069
This is my brother.

1257
00:53:19,237 --> 00:53:20,447
He died

1258
00:53:20,447 --> 00:53:21,781
five years ago.

1259
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:25,327
I was asking a lot of people if they knew who did it.

1260
00:53:25,327 --> 00:53:26,244
Did you?

1261
00:53:26,244 --> 00:53:27,370
Yeah.

1262
00:53:27,829 --> 00:53:30,207
Some people said yes, some people said no.

1263
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:33,543
Not like I could do something about it, though.

1264
00:53:33,543 --> 00:53:34,377
Yeah.

1265
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:39,716
After he died, then a couple other people that you

1266
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:43,720
knew and loved, died too, and so it was,

1267
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,805
you start really acting out.

1268
00:53:48,475 --> 00:53:50,685
This is my other friend, Gene.

1269
00:53:50,685 --> 00:53:53,772
This is the one that got shot in the back of the neck

1270
00:53:54,105 --> 00:53:55,690
and ran all the way to his granny house

1271
00:53:55,690 --> 00:53:57,275
and died on her floor.

1272
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:01,112
That was in the beginning of the school year.

1273
00:54:03,323 --> 00:54:04,449
You miss him?

1274
00:54:04,449 --> 00:54:04,866
Yeah.

1275
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:05,784
I do, too.

1276
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:07,285
Yeah?
Yeah.

1277
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:18,672
We used to play over there when we were little.

1278
00:54:18,672 --> 00:54:19,631
What was over there?

1279
00:54:19,631 --> 00:54:21,132
Just open field.

1280
00:54:22,342 --> 00:54:23,969
Was it bigger?

1281
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,097
And the tree was so shady.

1282
00:54:28,807 --> 00:54:30,642
Did he get killed like right there at the gate?

1283
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:33,645
And somebody had came up and shot him.

1284
00:54:33,645 --> 00:54:36,439
Too much death and you get too depressed,

1285
00:54:36,439 --> 00:54:39,150
it's almost like a war zone sometimes

1286
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:40,026
out here.

1287
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:44,322
Vinnie used to heckle balloons over there?

1288
00:54:44,322 --> 00:54:46,449
Yeah, balloons, teddy bears.

1289
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:47,742
Then what happened?

1290
00:54:48,076 --> 00:54:50,203
They put this gate up because at first the gate

1291
00:54:50,203 --> 00:54:51,246
wasn't there.

1292
00:54:51,955 --> 00:54:54,332
I'm trying to focus on school and sports,

1293
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:55,583
that's basically it.

1294
00:54:58,003 --> 00:55:00,422
And hopefully if I keep on playing sports,

1295
00:55:00,422 --> 00:55:02,757
that could probably get me out of here.

1296
00:55:02,757 --> 00:55:04,759
I could take my family out of Richmond.

1297
00:55:04,759 --> 00:55:06,845
We'd just move somewhere.

1298
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,054
Yeah, they grew up right here

1299
00:55:08,054 --> 00:55:09,764
just like I grew up on this block.

1300
00:55:09,764 --> 00:55:10,932
They all dead.

1301
00:55:14,311 --> 00:55:16,104
(bell rings)

1302
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:28,658
Alright, can I get somebody to lead today?

1303
00:55:28,658 --> 00:55:30,243
Do you want to, Omar?

1304
00:55:30,243 --> 00:55:32,871
Omar was participating today.

1305
00:55:32,871 --> 00:55:34,914
I mean, he participates in a way that's also

1306
00:55:34,914 --> 00:55:36,499
making a little bit of trouble.

1307
00:55:36,499 --> 00:55:38,126
He has a certain role

1308
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:40,420
and he's kind of determined to play the role

1309
00:55:40,420 --> 00:55:41,421
and participate.

1310
00:55:41,421 --> 00:55:43,506
And he seems to be managing that.

1311
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:45,800
Just very elegant.

1312
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:47,594
So hold on, what do you want to say?

1313
00:55:48,887 --> 00:55:50,722
Get in a mindful posture.

1314
00:55:53,641 --> 00:55:54,476
[Megan] Ebony.

1315
00:55:55,393 --> 00:55:56,019
Get up.

1316
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:57,520
[Megan] Oh, you have to be kind, though.

1317
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:58,688
Say it in a nice way.

1318
00:55:58,688 --> 00:56:00,648
Ebony, can you please sit up?

1319
00:56:00,648 --> 00:56:01,566
Thank you.

1320
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,609
[Megan] Thank you.

1321
00:56:02,609 --> 00:56:04,903
(students laughing)

1322
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,571
(bell rings)

1323
00:56:06,571 --> 00:56:10,492
Now look down, and listen to the bell, okay?

1324
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,327
Keep your eyes closed.

1325
00:56:14,662 --> 00:56:16,748
How do you feel right now?

1326
00:56:16,748 --> 00:56:17,582
Relaxed.

1327
00:56:17,582 --> 00:56:18,333
Relaxed?

1328
00:56:18,375 --> 00:56:19,000
Anything else?

1329
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:20,710
[Ling] I think Omar's reaching a point where he's taking

1330
00:56:20,710 --> 00:56:22,045
mindfulness seriously.

1331
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:23,338
Do you like being in front of a group?

1332
00:56:23,338 --> 00:56:24,506
Yeah, it's alright.

1333
00:56:24,964 --> 00:56:25,757
It's cool.

1334
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:28,176
He's really reflective, he thinks about

1335
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:31,429
what happens, he's able to look at both sides.

1336
00:56:31,429 --> 00:56:32,263
Alright.

1337
00:56:36,267 --> 00:56:37,560
Go ahead, ring it.

1338
00:56:37,602 --> 00:56:40,563
(bell rings)

1339
00:56:44,984 --> 00:56:47,779
Mindfulness kind of did surprise me.

1340
00:56:48,696 --> 00:56:53,118
I didn't think I was ever gonna use it but I did.

1341
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:55,412
Please notice how you're feeling right now.

1342
00:56:58,498 --> 00:57:00,959
We were outside in the yard, and then

1343
00:57:00,959 --> 00:57:03,128
some girl just made me mad.

1344
00:57:03,128 --> 00:57:05,672
She will beat your ass like Ruby.

1345
00:57:06,297 --> 00:57:10,051
I just felt like pulling her hair out

1346
00:57:10,093 --> 00:57:12,303
dropping to the floor and choke her.

1347
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:17,308
And I used mindfulness to calm down and not do nothing.

1348
00:57:17,308 --> 00:57:20,228
(girls laughing)

1349
00:57:20,228 --> 00:57:23,314
I like it, 'cause there's consequences for that.

1350
00:57:23,314 --> 00:57:26,609
I kind of feel happy 'cause I get to

1351
00:57:28,278 --> 00:57:31,865
really think about things and not make a mistake

1352
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:35,493
that I will regret doing later on.

1353
00:57:35,827 --> 00:57:37,120
Move over.

1354
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,209
When I get angry at other kids at school,

1355
00:57:43,209 --> 00:57:45,670
I'm really good at putting them at their spot.

1356
00:57:46,296 --> 00:57:48,339
Dirty old goat.

1357
00:57:48,548 --> 00:57:50,008
Oh, she didn't hear.

1358
00:57:50,592 --> 00:57:52,844
I've seen the sweet side of Jacqueline,

1359
00:57:52,844 --> 00:57:56,681
and I sometimes would like her to show it, but

1360
00:57:57,682 --> 00:58:00,977
I guess she doesn't really want anyone to see it.

1361
00:58:02,228 --> 00:58:04,981
(girls shouting)

1362
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,073
You trying to push me?

1363
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:19,120
So if I was gonna write down words for the Jackie

1364
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:22,916
that other people see, what words would I come up with?

1365
00:58:22,957 --> 00:58:24,209
Nice.

1366
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:25,460
Mm hmm.

1367
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:27,212
Funny.

1368
00:58:27,212 --> 00:58:28,505
Mm hmm.

1369
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:30,882
They look at me like I'm mean.

1370
00:58:30,882 --> 00:58:32,383
Sometimes they see you as mean?

1371
00:58:32,383 --> 00:58:33,510
Yes.

1372
00:58:33,510 --> 00:58:34,260
That's awful.

1373
00:58:34,260 --> 00:58:37,639
[Ling] Jacqueline likes participating in mindfulness.

1374
00:58:37,639 --> 00:58:39,098
I think that her

1375
00:58:39,098 --> 00:58:41,017
engagement has shifted.

1376
00:58:41,017 --> 00:58:43,061
Isn't it interesting that you can be both?

1377
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,648
I'm hoping that she starts to gain some perspective

1378
00:58:46,648 --> 00:58:49,400
on these incidents that are happening recently with

1379
00:58:49,400 --> 00:58:51,736
other girls and getting into fights and all this stuff

1380
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:54,697
and choose a different path for herself.

1381
00:58:54,697 --> 00:58:56,533
What's the Jackie on the inside?

1382
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:57,784
Shy.

1383
00:58:58,618 --> 00:59:01,913
I don't think doing mindfulness changes me at all.

1384
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:03,957
Do you think anybody knows you're shy?

1385
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:05,375
No.

1386
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,335
What about thoughtful?

1387
00:59:07,335 --> 00:59:08,253
No.

1388
00:59:08,253 --> 00:59:09,963
[Jacqueline Voiceover]
It's boring, but like,

1389
00:59:09,963 --> 00:59:14,259
I could use it as a tool if I'm mad or something.

1390
00:59:14,259 --> 00:59:16,094
When people see you as mean,

1391
00:59:17,595 --> 00:59:18,930
what's that all about?

1392
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,018
'Cause I push them around and like

1393
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:27,230
I hit them and stuff like that.

1394
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,232
So you kind of act tough.

1395
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,234
Is that who you are?

1396
00:59:31,234 --> 00:59:33,611
That is a little bit of who you are on the inside?

1397
00:59:33,611 --> 00:59:34,988
Okay, let's put that there.

1398
00:59:35,029 --> 00:59:37,824
That's really good for you to be honest about that.

1399
00:59:37,865 --> 00:59:39,826
A little mean on the inside, too.

1400
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:41,744
Yeah.

1401
00:59:41,744 --> 00:59:42,787
You okay with that?

1402
00:59:44,372 --> 00:59:45,623
Okay.

1403
00:59:45,623 --> 00:59:47,542
Where do you think that comes from?

1404
00:59:50,211 --> 00:59:51,588
I don't know.

1405
00:59:52,672 --> 00:59:54,799
She does use mindfulness, I don't know why she

1406
00:59:54,799 --> 00:59:57,093
doesn't say it, but she does.

1407
00:59:57,802 --> 01:00:00,638
She would have problems and I would help her out,

1408
01:00:00,638 --> 01:00:02,932
but sometimes she would just use mindfulness

1409
01:00:02,932 --> 01:00:04,309
to help herself.

1410
01:00:04,350 --> 01:00:06,561
Your battery is fucking low.

1411
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,314
(girls laughing)

1412
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:14,319
Good morning.

1413
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:17,822
Can I get everybody to turn your chairs towards the front?

1414
01:00:17,822 --> 01:00:19,824
Ring it again to get their attention

1415
01:00:19,824 --> 01:00:22,201
(bell rings)

1416
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:24,662
Good morning.

1417
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,248
Can you raise your hand if you remembered to use mindfulness

1418
01:00:27,248 --> 01:00:30,710
since I saw you on Wednesday?

1419
01:00:30,710 --> 01:00:32,629
Okay, that's a lot.

1420
01:00:32,629 --> 01:00:36,007
Can you keep your hand up if you're willing to say

1421
01:00:36,007 --> 01:00:37,383
when you used it?

1422
01:00:39,093 --> 01:00:40,345
Jacqueline.

1423
01:00:40,345 --> 01:00:41,304
Thursday.

1424
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,140
'Cause there was a problem.

1425
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,725
[Megan] And what kind of mindfulness did you use?

1426
01:00:45,725 --> 01:00:47,018
Breathing.

1427
01:00:47,018 --> 01:00:50,313
[Megan] And why did you decide to use breathing?

1428
01:00:50,313 --> 01:00:52,273
'Cause she told me to calm down.

1429
01:00:52,857 --> 01:00:53,816
[Megan] So Lesly was with you

1430
01:00:53,816 --> 01:00:54,984
and she told you to calm down?

1431
01:00:54,984 --> 01:00:55,818
Mm hmm.

1432
01:00:55,818 --> 01:00:58,446
[Megan] And did it work or help or change anything?

1433
01:00:58,446 --> 01:00:59,572
Mm hmm.

1434
01:01:00,698 --> 01:01:03,201
[Megan] Will you say anything more about it?

1435
01:01:03,201 --> 01:01:05,078
There's nothing else to say.

1436
01:01:05,078 --> 01:01:05,995
[Megan] Okay.

1437
01:01:07,997 --> 01:01:08,998
I know, alright.

1438
01:01:10,625 --> 01:01:14,379
When I have problems at school, I really don't talk to my

1439
01:01:14,420 --> 01:01:15,880
parents,

1440
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:18,383
not really my mom.

1441
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:21,844
I don't really feel like she can understand me.

1442
01:01:23,471 --> 01:01:27,266
I love my parents. I'm happy to have both of them.

1443
01:01:28,184 --> 01:01:31,104
I am the only sister, the only daughter.

1444
01:01:31,104 --> 01:01:34,649
I feel lonely with the two little brothers I have.

1445
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:37,151
Sometimes I get mad at them.

1446
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,571
Stop throwing it over there.

1447
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,742
(speaks in foreign language)

1448
01:01:44,992 --> 01:01:48,955
The way I deal with getting mad is that I would just

1449
01:01:49,414 --> 01:01:52,583
pretend nothing happens and keep it in me,

1450
01:01:52,583 --> 01:01:54,335
never let anybody know.

1451
01:01:55,253 --> 01:01:56,838
Same thing at school.

1452
01:01:56,838 --> 01:02:00,299
Someone makes me cry and no one else knew about it,

1453
01:02:01,134 --> 01:02:04,470
I would keep it to myself and pretend nothing happened.

1454
01:02:05,638 --> 01:02:07,765
I really have no way to let it out.

1455
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:12,228
It's always, like, loud everywhere I go.

1456
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:13,521
It's never quiet.

1457
01:02:13,521 --> 01:02:14,731
Never still.

1458
01:02:16,774 --> 01:02:19,694
When we meditate it's always quiet

1459
01:02:19,694 --> 01:02:21,821
and I get to listen to different sounds

1460
01:02:21,821 --> 01:02:22,655
and

1461
01:02:24,449 --> 01:02:26,993
it's really different for me.

1462
01:02:30,747 --> 01:02:33,499
My family would get interest and want to learn about

1463
01:02:33,499 --> 01:02:36,586
the mindfulness class and what I've learned from it.

1464
01:02:41,299 --> 01:02:45,136
(speaks in foreign language)
It's difficult to be patient.

1465
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:50,558
I understand that if she continues with this relaxation program

1466
01:02:50,558 --> 01:02:54,145
it will be calmer and relax this environment a bit.

1467
01:02:56,564 --> 01:02:59,859
I like that she's taking this program.

1468
01:02:59,859 --> 01:03:03,821
So that we can learn something about it through her.

1469
01:03:14,332 --> 01:03:16,667
I have art class for second period.

1470
01:03:21,005 --> 01:03:24,634
I like to draw, like, if I want to draw something about

1471
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:27,637
San Francisco, I like draw the buildings and stuff.

1472
01:03:27,637 --> 01:03:29,639
I like graffiti arts, too.

1473
01:03:29,639 --> 01:03:31,182
And one, two...

1474
01:03:31,224 --> 01:03:34,143
Not like drawing apples or nothing like that.

1475
01:03:34,143 --> 01:03:36,020
I don't really like that.

1476
01:03:36,020 --> 01:03:40,107
(hip hop music)

1477
01:03:42,819 --> 01:03:46,823
I draw everywhere to make myself more talented in a way.

1478
01:03:50,910 --> 01:03:54,789
With doing graffiti, I can see that the anger goes away

1479
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:57,708
and he will ask for time alone

1480
01:03:57,708 --> 01:03:58,835
to do that.

1481
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:03,881
If I practice,

1482
01:04:03,881 --> 01:04:06,509
I could be a painter like people here.

1483
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:09,095
I could have as much talent as anybody

1484
01:04:09,387 --> 01:04:11,556
but I just need to keep at it.

1485
01:04:14,475 --> 01:04:16,936
I don't really need to use mindfulness when I draw,

1486
01:04:16,936 --> 01:04:19,397
but like, it gives me a little boost to try to help me

1487
01:04:19,397 --> 01:04:22,733
concentrate and try to see what I wanna draw.

1488
01:04:26,070 --> 01:04:30,199
When I grow up, if I can paint or draw as a side job,

1489
01:04:30,199 --> 01:04:31,367
then that would be cool.

1490
01:04:31,367 --> 01:04:34,161
And if I could do it as a solid, solid job,

1491
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,914
then I would, yeah, I would definitely do that.

1492
01:04:37,790 --> 01:04:39,417
This is nice.

1493
01:04:41,669 --> 01:04:44,046
I think it's true that I'm in danger of failing

1494
01:04:44,046 --> 01:04:45,339
seventh grade.

1495
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:47,425
It doesn't mean that I'm gonna just quit.

1496
01:04:47,425 --> 01:04:50,261
It means that I'm gonna try harder to pass.

1497
01:04:52,430 --> 01:04:53,806
Mister Ehnle,

1498
01:04:53,806 --> 01:04:57,935
I wanted to know if you as a class have ever done

1499
01:04:57,935 --> 01:04:59,478
mindfulness without me?

1500
01:04:59,478 --> 01:04:59,979
[Student] Yes.

1501
01:05:00,021 --> 01:05:00,438
[Student] No.

1502
01:05:00,438 --> 01:05:01,397
We have not.

1503
01:05:01,439 --> 01:05:02,356
Okay,

1504
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:05,443
I wondered if you had a bell?

1505
01:05:05,443 --> 01:05:08,321
The classes that best sustain mindfulness,

1506
01:05:08,321 --> 01:05:10,698
the teachers and the students continue to use the bell

1507
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,199
even when the program is finished,

1508
01:05:12,199 --> 01:05:15,494
so that there's this constant tool in the classroom

1509
01:05:15,494 --> 01:05:17,705
to give a reminder of mindfulness and to facilitate

1510
01:05:17,705 --> 01:05:19,206
a mindful practice.

1511
01:05:22,293 --> 01:05:24,712
(bell rings)

1512
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:39,226
In terms of calming things down, refocusing,

1513
01:05:39,310 --> 01:05:41,938
mindfulness was worth the class time.

1514
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:44,273
No doubt about that.

1515
01:05:44,273 --> 01:05:45,566
It makes them feel

1516
01:05:45,566 --> 01:05:48,235
like thy have more control over themselves

1517
01:05:48,235 --> 01:05:50,988
and their behavior and that they aren't simply

1518
01:05:50,988 --> 01:05:52,865
victims of external circumstances.

1519
01:05:52,865 --> 01:05:55,993
So, now we're going to look at some math.

1520
01:05:55,993 --> 01:05:58,663
The volume of a circle,

1521
01:05:58,663 --> 01:06:01,082
Pi times radius squared.

1522
01:06:01,082 --> 01:06:03,042
Before mindfulness, I would just be like,

1523
01:06:03,042 --> 01:06:06,629
not knowing what to do, not paying attention to anything.

1524
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,507
And like now, when I need to sit down and do my work,

1525
01:06:09,507 --> 01:06:12,593
I just think about it and like, say, you gotta do this,

1526
01:06:12,593 --> 01:06:13,177
you know?

1527
01:06:13,219 --> 01:06:14,595
What word is this?

1528
01:06:14,595 --> 01:06:15,596
[Students] Though.

1529
01:06:15,596 --> 01:06:16,430
Though.

1530
01:06:18,140 --> 01:06:20,059
I think they feel better about what they're doing.

1531
01:06:20,059 --> 01:06:21,894
They have more self-confidence.

1532
01:06:21,894 --> 01:06:23,604
They're paying attention better.

1533
01:06:23,604 --> 01:06:27,566
That they feel more engaged in the lessons.

1534
01:06:28,901 --> 01:06:30,152
Okay, very good.

1535
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:32,488
My personality changed.

1536
01:06:32,488 --> 01:06:34,240
'Cause if there was a conflict before,

1537
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:35,658
I would probably be ready to fight.

1538
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,202
But now I'm just like, more,

1539
01:06:39,370 --> 01:06:41,205
laid back, calm.

1540
01:06:41,789 --> 01:06:45,751
[Mister Ehnle] We take a line of symmetry and then.

1541
01:06:45,751 --> 01:06:47,837
The role of the teacher has expanded.

1542
01:06:47,837 --> 01:06:50,464
The biggest challenge that we have is

1543
01:06:50,464 --> 01:06:52,383
changing our systems and structures within these

1544
01:06:52,383 --> 01:06:55,052
school buildings so the kids can fit in.

1545
01:06:55,052 --> 01:06:57,763
If you go and look at database indicators that help

1546
01:06:57,763 --> 01:06:58,556
students learn,

1547
01:06:58,556 --> 01:07:01,976
self-reflective behavior is way up on that list,

1548
01:07:01,976 --> 01:07:04,353
and that's one of the things that many of our good learners

1549
01:07:04,353 --> 01:07:07,773
bring that others don't bring to the school.

1550
01:07:07,773 --> 01:07:10,609
And so a program like this that helps teach kids that,

1551
01:07:10,609 --> 01:07:13,529
and helps it become a part of the practice within the school

1552
01:07:13,529 --> 01:07:16,615
and reinforces that is going to help them.

1553
01:07:22,163 --> 01:07:23,122
The whole mural,

1554
01:07:23,122 --> 01:07:25,833
it's about how we need more peace in the city.

1555
01:07:29,086 --> 01:07:30,755
The best part of making this piece

1556
01:07:30,755 --> 01:07:33,632
was working with other people.

1557
01:07:33,632 --> 01:07:36,385
I think mindfulness taught me how to calm down,

1558
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:39,430
to try to not put problems in the way of stuff

1559
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:41,891
and choose what I want to think

1560
01:07:41,891 --> 01:07:43,642
and choose how I want to feel.

1561
01:07:44,769 --> 01:07:45,978
Should I paint over it?

1562
01:07:46,020 --> 01:07:48,355
Yeah, and then maybe a layer of white?

1563
01:07:48,355 --> 01:07:50,399
Yeah, I know, paint over it.

1564
01:07:50,441 --> 01:07:52,985
The other teachers that tell me he can't do good,

1565
01:07:53,027 --> 01:07:54,612
all he does is disrupt, you know?

1566
01:07:54,612 --> 01:07:56,822
It's like finally somebody's saying that they're

1567
01:07:56,822 --> 01:07:58,074
impressed on what I do

1568
01:07:58,115 --> 01:08:00,201
and that they're happy that I'm there.

1569
01:08:01,160 --> 01:08:03,704
It makes me feel good, makes me feel like

1570
01:08:03,704 --> 01:08:05,289
I know I could do it.

1571
01:08:07,708 --> 01:08:10,419
Okay, so today is our

1572
01:08:10,419 --> 01:08:13,130
last day of mindfulness.

1573
01:08:13,130 --> 01:08:14,340
[Student] No!

1574
01:08:14,340 --> 01:08:17,510
(students applauding)

1575
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:20,554
Matt?

1576
01:08:21,722 --> 01:08:25,101
So, if you have a reaction, or something to say,

1577
01:08:25,101 --> 01:08:27,978
I want you to just notice it in yourself.

1578
01:08:27,978 --> 01:08:30,564
If you can not control your impulse,

1579
01:08:30,564 --> 01:08:34,777
you have to ask yourself, who's in control?

1580
01:08:38,823 --> 01:08:43,494
I'm gonna ask you to keep your eyes closed or down.

1581
01:08:43,494 --> 01:08:46,205
So I want you to notice the impulse to move your eyes

1582
01:08:46,205 --> 01:08:47,164
or move your body.

1583
01:08:47,164 --> 01:08:48,165
Or talk.

1584
01:08:48,833 --> 01:08:52,128
And really try to contain that so that you are in control,

1585
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,587
not something.

1586
01:08:53,587 --> 01:08:55,881
Mindfulness doesn't make problems go away.

1587
01:08:55,881 --> 01:08:58,425
It's a wrong assumption to think that if you

1588
01:08:58,425 --> 01:09:00,803
practice for a long time, then you'll never be angry again,

1589
01:09:00,803 --> 01:09:02,763
or you'll never have another problem or no one will

1590
01:09:02,763 --> 01:09:04,348
ever be mad at you.

1591
01:09:04,348 --> 01:09:05,766
That's not the point at all,

1592
01:09:05,766 --> 01:09:08,769
and you can never create that situation.

1593
01:09:08,769 --> 01:09:11,856
It's that the way you're meeting your experience changes

1594
01:09:11,856 --> 01:09:14,650
to allow more lightness and more happiness

1595
01:09:14,650 --> 01:09:16,235
to meet situations.

1596
01:09:16,235 --> 01:09:18,571
Just focusing on yourself,

1597
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:21,824
and respecting the people around you,

1598
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,869
and we'll listen to the sound of the bell.

1599
01:09:24,869 --> 01:09:27,079
(bell rings)

1600
01:09:27,079 --> 01:09:28,455
Noticing what distracts you,

1601
01:09:28,455 --> 01:09:31,292
and if you can stay focused for two minutes.

1602
01:09:34,003 --> 01:09:37,548
I don't know why I get distracted really easily.

1603
01:09:37,548 --> 01:09:39,300
Sometimes I get lazy.

1604
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,387
I'm gonna have to sit away from my friends

1605
01:09:43,387 --> 01:09:47,099
and control myself, do my work and not get lazy.

1606
01:09:47,933 --> 01:09:50,728
I did bring something for you today.

1607
01:09:51,937 --> 01:09:54,064
Matt, do you want to say something?

1608
01:09:54,064 --> 01:09:54,565
[Matt] Yes.

1609
01:09:54,565 --> 01:09:55,065
Okay.

1610
01:09:55,065 --> 01:09:56,567
[Matt] Is it raisins?

1611
01:09:56,567 --> 01:09:56,984
No.

1612
01:09:56,984 --> 01:09:58,027
Is it raisin bran?

1613
01:09:58,068 --> 01:09:58,569
[Megan] No.

1614
01:09:58,611 --> 01:09:59,737
(students laughing)

1615
01:09:59,737 --> 01:10:02,031
I will use mindfulness in the future.

1616
01:10:02,031 --> 01:10:04,533
I think I kind of take it for granted now.

1617
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:05,743
Megan comes in

1618
01:10:05,743 --> 01:10:08,996
and it's like, you get to relax.

1619
01:10:09,747 --> 01:10:11,415
Later on,

1620
01:10:11,415 --> 01:10:14,001
maybe a year from now or two,

1621
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,005
I think I'll use mindfulness more.

1622
01:10:19,590 --> 01:10:21,842
They're called pocket hearts.

1623
01:10:21,842 --> 01:10:26,138
Whenever you see it or feel it or remember it,

1624
01:10:26,138 --> 01:10:28,098
I want it to be something that reminds you that

1625
01:10:28,098 --> 01:10:30,893
you have a tool now that you can use

1626
01:10:30,893 --> 01:10:32,436
for the rest of your life.

1627
01:10:36,774 --> 01:10:38,943
Seeing how my dad works, like, it's stressful.

1628
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:41,570
I think I would want to use it if I was stressed.

1629
01:10:41,570 --> 01:10:43,113
It's like something in your backpack,

1630
01:10:43,155 --> 01:10:44,573
it's always there and you can just pull it out

1631
01:10:44,615 --> 01:10:45,491
and use it.

1632
01:10:49,453 --> 01:10:50,788
Once you have your heart,

1633
01:10:50,788 --> 01:10:51,830
I want you to think about

1634
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,375
at least one thing that you've learned.

1635
01:10:54,375 --> 01:10:57,753
I get distracted by many people who are sitting beside me.

1636
01:10:57,795 --> 01:10:59,838
They're gonna start teasing me and bothering me

1637
01:10:59,838 --> 01:11:01,131
about everything.

1638
01:11:01,340 --> 01:11:04,343
I just like going to a private place and saying

1639
01:11:04,343 --> 01:11:06,679
all my thoughts inside of me, what I feel.

1640
01:11:06,679 --> 01:11:09,932
Nobody is there to look and see anything that I do.

1641
01:11:12,184 --> 01:11:13,978
Can anybody say how school would be different

1642
01:11:13,978 --> 01:11:15,854
if everybody practiced mindfulness?

1643
01:11:15,854 --> 01:11:16,689
Yeah?

1644
01:11:16,689 --> 01:11:17,523
No bullying.

1645
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:18,524
[Megan] No bullying, yeah.

1646
01:11:18,524 --> 01:11:21,151
Why do you think that would make no bullying happen?

1647
01:11:21,193 --> 01:11:24,113
